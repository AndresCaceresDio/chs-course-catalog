<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Federal Question Jurisdiction</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The primary statute governing federal subject-matter jurisdiction is 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1331, which grants federal courts jurisdiction over &quot;all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,&quot; also known as federal question jurisdiction. This is determined by the &apos;well-pleaded complaint rule,&apos; meaning the federal question must be presented in the plaintiff&apos;s original claim; it cannot be based on a potential defense or counterclaim. Additionally, the claim must be substantial, and the resolution of the federal question must be necessary to the resolution of the case.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Jane, a resident of Vermont, files a lawsuit in federal court against Larry, a resident of Vermont, alleging that Larry&apos;s actions violated her First Amendment rights, a constitutional issue. Since Jane&apos;s well-pleaded complaint establishes a federal question, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1331. However, if Jane&apos;s lawsuit centered on a breach of contract claim and Larry&rsquo;s defense was that his actions were protected by the First Amendment, the federal court would not have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1331, as the federal question arises as a defense, not as part of Jane&apos;s original claim. Furthermore, if Jane&apos;s claim involved a minor, hypothetical issue related to the Patent Act that wouldn&apos;t affect the outcome of her breach of contract claim, the federal courts might decline to exercise jurisdiction because the federal issue isn&apos;t substantial and necessary for the case&apos;s resolution.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Diversity Jurisdiction</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Meanwhile, 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1332 provides for diversity jurisdiction, which applies when the case is between citizens of different states, or a citizen of a state and a citizen or subject of a foreign country, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. Diversity jurisdiction requires complete diversity between the parties, meaning each plaintiff must be from a different state or country than each defendant. This jurisdiction is intended to prevent state court bias against out-of-state parties and to provide a neutral forum for these disputes. For the purposes of diversity, a corporation is considered a citizen of the state where it is incorporated and where it has its principal place of business (both locations), and the amount in controversy is measured based on the value of the object of the litigation or the plaintiff&apos;s potential recovery.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Jane, a Florida resident, sues Acme Corp, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Georgia, in federal court for breach of contract, seeking damages of $100,000. Here, the federal court has diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1332 because Jane and Acme Corp are citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. On the other hand, if Jane were to include her friend Bob, another Florida resident, as a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit against Acme Corp, the complete diversity requirement would not be satisfied since both Jane and Bob are from the same state, Florida. Thus, the federal court would not have diversity jurisdiction in this scenario. Additionally, in a separate claim, Jane sues Carlos, a citizen of Mexico, in federal court stating that Carlos&apos;s property in Mexico, valued at $80,000, rightfully belongs to her. The federal court would have diversity jurisdiction since the parties are citizens of different countries and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Amount in Controversy Calculation</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">For determining whether the amount in controversy exceeds the $75,000 threshold for diversity jurisdiction, the court looks at the claim as pleaded by the plaintiff. In cases where the amount is unclear, the court will use the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine if it is more likely than not that the claim meets the threshold. Claims of different plaintiffs cannot be aggregated to meet this amount unless they are jointly entitled to a single title or right in which the object of the litigation is indivisible.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Jane Doe, a resident of Arizona, sues Bob&apos;s Electronics, a company based in Texas, for breach of contract, demanding $70,000 in damages. Simultaneously, Jane includes a claim for emotional distress, valuing it at $10,000, thus asserting a total amount of $80,000. Bob&apos;s Electronics contests the jurisdiction, claiming the amount in controversy requirement is not met. The court reviews the claim as Jane has pleaded, which on its face exceeds $75,000. However, Bob&apos;s Electronics disputes the value of the emotional distress claim. The court applies the preponderance of the evidence standard and evaluates Jane&apos;s proof of emotional distress. Finding that Jane has provided sufficient evidence, the court concludes it is more likely than not that her total claim meets the threshold and allows the case to proceed under diversity jurisdiction. In a separate instance, Pedro and Luisa Martinez, a married couple from Florida, individually sue QuickFix Pharma, a New York corporation, for negligible side effects experienced from a drug produced by the company. Pedro claims $50,000, and Luisa claims $30,000. They attempt to bring their cases in federal court to take advantage of diversity jurisdiction. However, their claims are for separate instances of harm and therefore represent distinct titles and rights to relief. Even though combined they exceed $75,000, the federal court does not consolidate their claims to meet the threshold as they are not jointly entitled to a single title or right where the object of the litigation, individual relief for personal harm, is divisible. Thus, their claims must be evaluated separately and neither meets the $75,000 requirement, precluding diversity jurisdiction for both claims.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Special Domicile Cases</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In the realm of federal jurisdiction, particularly concerning diversity cases, the concept of domicile takes on special considerations in several instances. For resident aliens, their domicile for jurisdictional purposes is based on their current state of residence, where they reside with the intention to remain indefinitely. Unincorporated associations, such as partnerships and LLCs, present a more complex scenario; these entities are treated as citizens of every state of which their members are citizens, potentially spanning multiple states and affecting the diversity status of a case. Furthermore, when legal representatives, such as executors or guardians, are involved in litigation on behalf of decedents, minors, or incompetents, the court looks to the domicile of these individuals rather than the legal representatives&apos; domicile to determine jurisdiction.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Kyle, a resident alien living in Texas with intentions to remain indefinitely, sues QuickFix Partners, an unincorporated association with members from Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma, for breach of contract in federal court, seeking $200,000 in damages. The court lacks diversity jurisdiction since Kyle, as a plaintiff domiciled in Texas, shares a common state with one of the members of QuickFix Partners, destroying complete diversity. In addition, Emily, a Colorado citizen serving as the legal guardian for her nephew Tim, a minor domiciled in Utah, files a suit on his behalf against Mountain Gear LLC, a company domiciled in Vermont. The federal court considers Tim&apos;s Utah domicile, not Emily&apos;s, when assessing diversity jurisdiction, which in this case is properly established since there&apos;s no common domicile between Tim and the defendant, Mountain Gear LLC, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Supplemental Jurisdiction</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1367, federal courts may have supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims that are part of the same case or controversy, or the same &ldquo;nucleus of operative facts&rdquo; as those claims that invoked federal question or diversity jurisdiction. This allows federal courts to hear state-law claims that are so related to the federal claims that they form part of the same case or controversy, promoting efficiency and judicial economy. However, a court can decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if the state-law claims substantially predominate, the federal claims are dismissed early in the proceedings, or the state law claim is complex. It&rsquo;s important to note that supplemental jurisdiction can only be invoked if the case is already in federal court.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a lawsuit where Ava files against a pharmaceutical company, OmniMed, in federal court for patent infringement (a federal question), Ava also includes a claim for breach of contract based on state law. Since the breach of contract claim is related to the same set of facts as the patent claim, the federal court has supplemental jurisdiction over Ava&apos;s state-law claim under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1367. The claims are part of the same case and revolve around the same nucleus of operative facts, namely the alleged unauthorized use of Ava&apos;s patented technology in OmniMed&apos;s products. However, during the proceedings, the patent claim is resolved quickly in OmniMed&apos;s favor through a summary judgment motion. Following this, the court decides to drop the breach of contract claim, declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction because the main federal question, the patent infringement, is no longer part of the lawsuit and the state-law claim for breach of contract now substantially predominates. Moreover, if alongside the breach of contract claim Ava had added a complex state antitrust claim against OmniMed, the court might refuse to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over this issue from the outset, recognizing its complexity and the special proficiency state courts have over such state law matters.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Special Rules for Supplemental Jurisdiction</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Supplemental jurisdiction allows a defendant in a diversity case to adjudicate related counterclaims, crossclaims, and impleaders without meeting the diversity requirement for the parties they bring into the lawsuit. However, plaintiffs face a limitation; they cannot invoke supplemental jurisdiction to bypass the diversity criterion. On the other hand, both plaintiffs and defendants can utilize supplemental jurisdiction to address claims that do not meet the amount in controversy threshold, as well as to append state law claims to a case that already includes federal question claims.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a breach of contract lawsuit where Sandra, a resident of California, sues MobileTech Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York, for $100,000 in federal court, the diversity jurisdiction requirements are met. When MobileTech counterclaims for $50,000 due to alleged defamation by Sandra, supplemental jurisdiction allows the counterclaim to proceed in federal court despite not meeting the amount in controversy requirement because it arises from the same case. However, if Sandra attempts to add a friend from California, Paul, as an additional plaintiff in her defamation claim for $40,000 against MobileTech&apos;s CEO, a New York resident, the court cannot exercise supplemental jurisdiction as this would violate the complete diversity rule for plaintiffs. Conversely, if Sandra&apos;s claim included a federal question, then Paul&apos;s related state law defamation claim might qualify for supplemental jurisdiction along with the federal question claim already before the court.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Removal Jurisdiction</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Per 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1441, only defendants have the ability to remove a case to federal court, provided that the federal court has jurisdiction over the matter, and all defendants unanimously agree to the removal. Such removal must be executed within 30 days of receiving the initial pleading or summons that allows for removal, though diversity jurisdiction cases impose a further restriction that removal cannot occur if any defendant is domiciled in the state where the action was filed (the &lsquo;home state defendant rule&rsquo;). Additionally, defendants forfeit the right to remove if they file a permissive (non-compulsory) counterclaim in state court. The case must be removed to the federal district court that encompasses the state court where the action was originally filed. In terms of timing, removal based on diversity jurisdiction is not permissible if more than one year has passed since the case was filed in state court. When a case contains both removable and non-removable claims, defendants may opt to remove the entire case to federal court for adjudication.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Kyle and Lena are California residents who sue EcoFriendly Inc., a company headquartered in Texas, in California superior court. They allege EcoFriendly&apos;s products infringe on their patents and also include a breach of contract claim under California state law. EcoFriendly receives the summons and a copy of the complaint on January 1st. EcoFriendly, understanding that the patent infringement claim gives rise to federal question jurisdiction, intends to remove the case to federal court. All defendants must agree to the removal, and in this case, EcoFriendly is the sole defendant. They filed a notice of removal in the appropriate U.S. District Court for the Central District of California well within the 30-day timeline, on January 15th. Now consider that EcoFriendly, instead of removing, decides to file a counterclaim in the California court for a completely unrelated trademark issue, which is non-compulsory. By doing so, EcoFriendly has engaged in &quot;litigating&quot; in state court, thereby waiving its right to remove the case to federal court later. In a twist, suppose the action was initially filed with multiple defendants and one of them, GreenTech, is also incorporated in California. GreenTech&apos;s presence as a &apos;home state defendant&apos; means that, under the 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1441 &lsquo;home state defendant rule&rsquo;, the case is not removable on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, despite the presence of EcoFriendly, a foreign company. Fast forward to eleven months after the initial filing, Lena decides to drop the patent infringement claim, leaving only the state law breach of contract claim active. EcoFriendly now wishes to remove based on diversity jurisdiction, considering they are from Texas and the amount in controversy exceeds the threshold, but because they are a &lsquo;home state defendant&rsquo;, removal remains barred. Even if that were not the case, the action has been pending for more than a year, which exceeds the removal deadline for a diversity-based jurisdiction case.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Exceptions and Restrictions</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Certain types of cases are excluded from federal subject-matter jurisdiction; namely cases involving divorce, alimony, child custody, or probate. Under abstention doctrines like Younger and Pullman, federal courts may defer to state courts if a case is already being heard at the state level or if it hinges on unclear state laws that could resolve the federal questions involved.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In the middle of a heated divorce, Rachel sues her soon-to-be ex-husband Ethan in federal court for alimony, initiating the case directly in federal court rather than state court. The federal court will dismiss the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because federal courts are excluded from cases involving divorce and alimony. Simultaneously, Ethan tries to obtain a federal court&apos;s injunction to halt the ongoing state court proceedings, claiming a violation of his federal constitutional rights due to the state&apos;s handling of the case. However, under the Younger abstention doctrine, the federal court will likely refuse to grant the injunction because the state proceedings involve important state interests and provide Ethan with an adequate opportunity to raise his constitutional claims. Concurrently, in a separate matter, MobileTech Inc. files a federal lawsuit challenging a vague Texas business regulation. The federal court could invoke the Pullman abstention doctrine and stay the federal case, allowing the Texas state courts to clarify the regulation first, which might negate the need for addressing the federal constitutional question.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Remandment and Concurrency</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Remandment in federal subject matter jurisdiction occurs when a case initially brought to a federal court is sent back to the state court of the state where it is situated. This typically happens if the federal court determines it lacks subject matter jurisdiction or if other statutory grounds for remand are met. Concurrency, or concurrent jurisdiction, refers to situations where both state and federal courts have the authority to hear a case because it involves certain claims or parties that satisfy the requirements for federal jurisdiction but do not preclude state court jurisdiction. Concurrency does not apply in situations where federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over certain types of cases. This includes matters such as bankruptcy, federal tax disputes, federal antitrust actions, patent infringements, and certain cases involving federal statutes that specify exclusive federal jurisdiction. In these instances, only federal courts can preside over the cases, and state courts have no authority to hear them. Additionally, state courts cannot hear cases that involve the interpretation and application of the United States Constitution where federal law requires exclusive federal jurisdiction.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff, a resident of State A, files a lawsuit against Corporation, incorporated in State B with its principal place of business in State C, in federal court alleging breach of a business contract and a violation of federal antitrust laws. The federal court has subject matter jurisdiction over the antitrust claim due to federal question jurisdiction, and since the parties are from different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, the court also has diversity jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim, thus establishing concurrency. After reviewing the case, the federal court determines that the breach of contract claim does not meet the amount in controversy requirement, only the federal antitrust claim does. The court decides to remand the breach of contract claim to the state court, as it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this portion of the case because it no longer meets the diversity jurisdiction requirements. The antitrust claim remains in federal court because it arises under federal law and federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over federal antitrust actions. Additionally, the state court cannot hear the antitrust claim, even under concurrent jurisdiction, due to the exclusive jurisdiction provided to federal courts for these types of cases.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>





<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Traditional Bases of Minimum Contacts</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under traditional legal doctrine, there are four distinct circumstances where a court assumes that minimum contacts exist, thus granting personal jurisdiction over a defendant:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Domicile:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The defendant being domiciled in the forum state automatically establishes personal jurisdiction.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Presence:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">If a defendant (or their agent) is physically present within a state and has arrived there willfully, rather than being coerced, a court in that state may exercise personal jurisdiction over them. This concept can give rise to what is known as &apos;tag jurisdiction,&apos; a scenario in which serving a defendant with legal process while they are in a state &mdash; even if only for a brief time, such as an hour &mdash; provides that state&apos;s court with the authority to preside over legal matters involving the defendant.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A defendant flies to a state for a business meeting and while at the airport, a process server delivers a summon to them for a lawsuit related to a breach of contract case filed by a plaintiff in that state. Since the defendant was physically present and had traveled to the state willfully for business purposes, the court in that state can assert personal jurisdiction over the defendant under the concept of &apos;tag jurisdiction.&apos; Even though the defendant only planned to be in the state for a brief time before flying back, the act of being served within the state&apos;s borders allows the court to have authority in the legal matter concerning the defendant.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Waiver:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">If the defendant fails to raise the issue early in the proceedings, such as by not filing a pretrial motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, they are considered to have consented to the court&apos;s jurisdiction, thereby waiving any objections to it.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Kyle is sued by Lena in a state where he does not reside or have significant contacts. However, Kyle does not raise any objections to personal jurisdiction in his initial response to the lawsuit. By engaging with the court process and proceeding to the discovery phase without contesting jurisdiction, Kyle has implicitly consented to the court&apos;s authority over him, waiving his right to challenge personal jurisdiction later in the proceedings. In a different scenario, Larry is also sued in a state with which he has minimal connections. Unlike Kyle, Larry immediately files a motion to dismiss due to lack of personal jurisdiction. This timely motion preserves Larry&apos;s right to object to the court&apos;s jurisdiction. If Larry had instead participated extensively in the litigation and then attempted to raise the issue of personal jurisdiction at a summary judgment stage or at trial, the court would likely find that he waived this defense by not bringing it up at the first available opportunity.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Consent:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">If the defendant expressly (such as in a contract) or impliedly (such as driving on the roads of the state, where you impliedly consent to the traffic law of the ) consents to the court&rsquo;s personal jurisdiction over them, then personal jurisdiction over them is established.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Daniel signs a contract with a provision stating that disputes will be resolved in the New York courts, establishing express consent to personal jurisdiction in New York. Therefore, when a dispute arises, the New York court has personal jurisdiction over Daniel. Meanwhile, Michelle, driving through New Jersey, implicitly consents to New Jersey&apos;s jurisdiction concerning traffic laws. When she is involved in a traffic incident, personal jurisdiction is established and a New Jersey court can hear any case related to this incident.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Long-Arm Statutes and Minimum Contacts</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">When the traditional bases for personal jurisdiction are not satisfied, long-arm statutes enable a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant located outside the state when the defendant has engaged in activities that create minimum contacts with the state. Minimum contacts in these cases can be based on general or specific jurisdiction.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Amber, a resident of State A, purchases a car from Fast Wheels, Inc., a car manufacturer headquartered in State B. After an accident, Amber discovers the car had a manufacturing defect and decides to sue Fast Wheels in State A. Fast Wheels has no physical presence in State A but has advertised and sold cars there through an independent dealer, creating minimum contacts with State A. Under State A&apos;s long-arm statute, the state court can assert personal jurisdiction over Fast Wheels because their business activities, such as selling cars, establish sufficient minimum contacts. This is an example of specific jurisdiction because Fast Wheels&apos; actions that led to the lawsuit occurred within State A, although the corporation is located in another state. Conversely, if Fast Wheels, Inc. also conducts continuous and systematic business in State A, such as operating a network of dealerships and service centers, then State A&apos;s courts may claim general jurisdiction over Fast Wheels for any lawsuit against them, even if the suit is unrelated to their activities within State A. This is because their extensive activities in State A have given them a &ldquo;continuous and systematic&rdquo; presence in the state, satisfying the threshold for general jurisdiction.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">General Jurisdiction</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">General jurisdiction exists when a defendant&apos;s affiliations with the forum state are so continuous, systematic, and substantial as to render them essentially &ldquo;at home&rdquo; in the forum state. If general jurisdiction applies, then the state has personal jurisdiction over all claims brought to the defendant, even if they don&rsquo;t arise from the defendant&rsquo;s contacts with the state. General jurisdiction is rarely seen due to the high threshold required, but it can be invoked in cases involving defendants whose business operations or personal engagements within the state are so significant that they parallel the level of activity one would typically expect from a resident or local business entity.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Kyle, the CEO of TechSpark, a company with a small office in Ohio but headquartered and incorporated in California, is sued for breach of contract in Ohio. Although TechSpark&apos;s Ohio operations are not negligible, they are not substantial enough to render TechSpark &quot;at home&quot; in Ohio, so general jurisdiction likely does not exist in this case. Conversely, Larry&apos;s enterprise, GlobalAuto, which is incorporated in Texas and has its largest manufacturing plant there, faces a patent lawsuit in Texas. Given GlobalAuto&apos;s significant presence in Texas, the court likely has general jurisdiction, meaning it can hear any claims against GlobalAuto, regardless of where the claims arose, since the company&apos;s affiliations with Texas are so substantial as to consider it &quot;at home&quot; in the state.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Specific Jurisdiction</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Specific jurisdiction exists when two elements are satisfied:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Purposeful availment:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The defendant purposefully availed themselves to the benefits and protections of the state.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Foreseeability:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The defendant could have foreseen being hauled into a court in the state.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Once specific jurisdiction has been established, the defendant can only be sued on a claim that directly arises from their contacts with the forum state.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Tyler, an independent software developer based in State X, develops an app that he markets nationwide. Emma, a resident of State Y, purchases Tyler&apos;s app, but later sues Tyler in her home state, State Y, claiming the app damaged her device due to a coding error. For State Y to assert specific jurisdiction over Tyler, the court will look for purposeful availment and foreseeability. Tyler advertised his app on a nationwide platform and specifically targeted customers in multiple states, including State Y, through regional online ads. By deriving substantial revenue from customers in State Y, Tyler purposefully availed himself of the market in that state. Concerning foreseeability, it was reasonable for Tyler to anticipate being sued in State Y since he engaged in marketing efforts directed at consumers in that state. Therefore, specific jurisdiction in State Y is proper as Tyler&apos;s actions created sufficient minimum contacts with State Y, and Emma&apos;s claim arises directly from Tyler&apos;s contacts with the state - the alleged coding error in the app he sold to residents of State Y, including Emma.</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Traditional Notions of Fair Play and Substantial Justice (TNFPSJ)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Once it is determined that the defendant has the requisite minimum contacts, the court will consider whether the exercise of jurisdiction comports with fair play and substantial justice. Factors include the burden on the defendant, the forum state&apos;s interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiff&rsquo;s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, the interstate judicial system&rsquo;s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Kyle, a resident of Washington, purchases a defective piece of equipment from HarvestCo, an agricultural company based in Iowa. Kyle files a lawsuit in Washington state court. The court considers Kyle&apos;s minimum contacts with Iowa, established by his purchase and the company&apos;s targeted marketing to Washington residents. To determine if exercising jurisdiction over HarvestCo in Washington is fair, the court evaluates: 1) whether defending a suit in Washington would pose a significant burden on Iowa-based HarvestCo; 2) Washington&apos;s interest in protecting its residents from defective products; 3) Kyle&apos;s interest in obtaining relief without the inconvenience of an out-of-state trial; 4) the interest in efficiently resolving the dispute, possibly favoring Iowa if most evidence and witnesses are located there; and 5) how the case outcome could influence agricultural equipment standards, implicating broader social policies beyond one state&rsquo;s borders. If these factors weigh in favor of Kyle and establish that bringing HarvestCo into Washington&apos;s jurisdiction is reasonable, the court may proceed with the case. If not, it may decline to exercise jurisdiction on the grounds of not comporting with fair play and substantial justice.</span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">General Rules of Service</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">After the case has been correctly filed with the court, a summons must be served to the defendant with a copy of the complaint. Under Rule 4(m), a plaintiff must serve the defendant within 90 days after filing the complaint. If the plaintiff fails to do so without good cause, the court must dismiss the action without prejudice against the defendant or order that service be made within a specified time. Service can be performed by any non-party who is 18 years old or older, or by a person specially appointed by the court. After service is made, Rule 4(l) requires that the serving party must provide proof of service to the court, typically by filing a sworn statement or affidavit with the court clerk.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Miranda files a breach of contract lawsuit against Digital Solutions, Inc. in federal district court on January 1st. To comply with Rule 4(m), she must ensure that Digital Solutions is served with a summons and a copy of the complaint by March 31st, which is 90 days after the filing of the complaint. Miranda hires Zack, a 25-year-old professional process server and non-party to the case, to serve the summons. Zack completes service on January 15th by personally delivering the documents to Digital Solutions&apos; registered agent as required by law. Following the successful service, Zack provides Miranda with a sworn affidavit of service, which Miranda then files with the court clerk before the next scheduled court date to show proof of service. If Miranda had failed to serve Digital Solutions by the 90-day deadline and also lacked a valid reason for the delay, the court would be faced with a decision. Either the court might dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice, allowing Miranda to refile in the future, or the court might grant her additional time to complete service if convinced there was good cause for the delay.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Waiver of Service</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 4(d) provides for waiver of service, allowing a party to avoid the cost of service if the defendant agrees to waive formal service of the summons. A plaintiff may notify the defendant of the action and request that they waive service. If the defendant agrees to waive service, they have 60 days from the date the request was sent (or 90 days if the defendant is outside any judicial district of the United States) to return the waiver.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff decides to sue a defendant for a civil matter and opts to save costs by using Rule 4(d) for a waiver of service. The plaintiff sends a notification to the defendant with a request to waive formal service of the summons, including a copy of the complaint and a waiver form. The defendant, acknowledging the request, signs the waiver form indicating they waive the right to formal service and returns it to the plaintiff within the allotted 60 days since the defendant is located within the United States. This waiver gives the defendant an extended time to respond to the complaint, allowing for a more cost-effective and efficient initiation of the legal proceedings.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Service on Individuals</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">For individuals in the United States, Rule 4(e) allows service in 4 ways (SAID):</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">State law:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Following the state law methods where service is made.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Agent:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Delivering the documents to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Individual:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Delivering a summons and a copy of the complaint to the individual personally.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Dwelling:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Leaving the documents at the individual&apos;s dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A process server arrives at the defendant&apos;s home to serve a summons and complaint. The defendant is not at home, but the defendant&apos;s adult sibling is currently visiting and staying at the residence. The server leaves the documents with the defendant&rsquo;s sibling, who is over the age of eighteen and understands the importance of the documents. This service is considered proper under the concept of dwelling service because the documents were left at the defendant&rsquo;s usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there, fulfilling the requirements for effective service of process.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Service on Corporations, Partnerships, and Associations</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under Rule 4(h), service in a domestic or foreign corporation, or a partnership or other unincorporated association, may be executed by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff initiates a lawsuit against a corporation for breach of contract. To properly serve the corporation under Rule 4(h), the plaintiff delivers a copy of the summons and complaint to the corporation&apos;s Vice President, who is an officer of the company, thus effectuating proper service. In another instance, the plaintiff attempts to serve an unincorporated association involved in a property dispute by handing the summons and complaint to a member who is not an officer or a managing agent. This does not constitute valid service under Rule 4(h) as the member lacks the authority to receive service on behalf of the association. Service is only proper if it is delivered to an individual who, by the association&apos;s appointment or by law, is authorized to accept service.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Service by Publication</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">When an individual cannot be located after a diligent search, Rule 4(e)(1) allows for service by publication in a newspaper of general circulation, as provided by state law for serving a summons or like process on a defendant who cannot be found or served within the state.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff seeks to sue a defendant for breach of contract, but the defendant has moved without a forwarding address and cannot be located after a diligent search. The plaintiff then follows the state&rsquo;s specific procedure for serving a summons by publication, placing a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the defendant was last known to reside. This service by publication is done in accordance with Rule 4(e)(1) and the state&apos;s laws for serving individuals who cannot be found within the state. The court, recognizing the plaintiff&apos;s adherence to the prescribed legal process for service of process under such circumstances, allows the case to proceed.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Service on Governmental Entities</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">When serving the United States, its agencies, corporations, officers, or employees sued in an official capacity, Rule 4(i) requires that a plaintiff serve the U.S. Attorney for the district where the action is brought, as well as send a copy to the Attorney General of the United States. Additional rules apply for service on state or local governments, which include serving the chief executive officer or by serving in a manner prescribed by state law.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff brings a lawsuit against a federal agency for wrongful termination of employment. To properly serve the United States under Rule 4(i), the plaintiff&apos;s attorney sends the summons and complaint to the U.S. Attorney&apos;s office for the district in which the lawsuit was filed and mails a copy to the Attorney General of the United States. Simultaneously, the plaintiff wants to sue the state employment agency involved in the enforcement of the employment policy that led to the termination. To serve the state government, the plaintiff serves the governor as the chief executive officer of the state and also follows the particular service process outlined in the state&apos;s laws, which might include delivering the documents to the state&apos;s attorney general or a designated state government agent.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>





<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Venue in federal court refers to the proper judicial district, not state, where a lawsuit can be filed and conducted. The choice of venue is guided by statutes and intended to ensure convenience for the parties and witnesses while also considering the interest of justice.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">General Venue Requirement</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1391, a civil action may be brought (1) in a judicial district where any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the state in which the district is located; (2) where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of the property that is the subject of the action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in which the action may otherwise be brought, any judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court&apos;s personal jurisdiction with respect to the action in question. Venue is waived by the defendant if they do not object to the complaint in their first response.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff from California sues a corporation headquartered in New York, with offices across the United States, for breach of contract. The corporation conducts regular business in California but is formally incorporated and has its principal place of business in New York. The contract in question was negotiated and executed while both parties were in California, and the alleged breach occurred due to actions taken by the corporation&apos;s California office. The plaintiff files the lawsuit in a federal district court in California. The corporation, as the defendant, may be sued in California since it conducts business there and is considered to reside in that state according to the state&apos;s long-arm statute. Additionally, a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in California, fulfilling the second venue option. However, the corporation prefers to have the case heard in New York and moves to transfer the venue to New York based on their headquarters&apos; location. Their first response to the complaint is a motion to dismiss for improper venue. In an alternative scenario, the corporation does not immediately object to the venue in its first response to the complaint but instead answers the allegations of the breach. By not objecting to the venue in their initial response, the corporation waives any venue objections, and the case proceeds in the California federal district court.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Forum Non Conveniens</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Forum non conveniens is a legal doctrine that allows courts to dismiss a case when another court, or forum, is deemed more appropriate for hearing the case. This doctrine is grounded in the interest of justice and efficiency, ensuring that the case is heard in a location that is most convenient for the parties and witnesses and where the case can be tried more expeditiously and inexpensively.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Kyle, a resident of Texas, files a lawsuit in a New York court against Lara, a citizen of France, concerning a business dispute that arose entirely in France with all material witnesses located there. Despite New York having jurisdiction, it exercises forum non conveniens, dismissing the case because the French courts are a more appropriate venue given the location of evidence and witnesses, ensuring a more efficient and just resolution. Conversely, Larry sues a California company, Dynamic Tech, in his home state of Montana for a breach of contract that occurred in California, where most witnesses and evidence are situated. Montana may choose not to dismiss the case under forum non conveniens, as the inconvenience is not as pronounced, and both jurisdictions are in the United States, mitigating concerns of efficiency and legal differences that might arise with international cases.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Transfer of Venue for Cases Filed in a Proper District</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1404(a), for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil case that was filed in the correct district to another district or division where it could have been brought. The court considers factors including the convenience of the parties, the convenience of the witnesses, the availability of documents and other evidence, the domicile of the parties, the ability to enforce a judgment, and the interests of justice.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Jessica filed a civil lawsuit against TechnoCorp, a technology company for alleged patent infringement in the Eastern District of Texas. TechnoCorp is headquartered in the Northern District of California, where all its executives, relevant witnesses, and documentary evidence are located. TechnoCorp requests the Eastern District of Texas to transfer the case to the Northern District of California under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1404(a), arguing that the transfer would significantly reduce travel burdens on witnesses and parties, ensure the prompt availability of evidence, and serve the interests of justice, as the locus of all relevant events is in California. The court agrees that the Northern District of California is a venue where the case could have originally been brought, considering the defendant&apos;s headquarters is there. It further notes that transferring the case would diminish disruptions to TechnoCorp&rsquo;s operations and make it easier for local witnesses to attend proceedings. Additionally, California courts can readily enforce the judgment, and the transfer aligns with the interests of justice by centralizing litigation in the primary related venue. Balancing all these factors, the court grants the transfer to the Northern District of California.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Transfer of Venue or Dismissal for Cases Filed in an Improper District</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">If a case is filed in a district that is determined to be improper, the court may either dismiss the case or, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer it to a district in which it could have been brought under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1406(a). This is separate from the provision for change of venue for convenience under &sect; 1404(a), as it deals specifically with cases filed in the objectively wrong venue.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a scenario where TechAdvisors LLC is sued by a client in a district court of Alaska for a contractual dispute, the court finds that the proper venue is not in Alaska, as neither the company conducts business there nor is the dispute related to any activities in Alaska. Under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1406(a), since the case was filed in the wrong venue, the court has the option to dismiss the claim. However, considering that the interest of justice is better served by having the case heard rather than dismissed, the court decides to transfer the case to the Northern District of Illinois, where TechAdvisors LLC has its principal business activities and where the case could have been originally filed. This transfer is made to correct the venue error, different from a &sect; 1404(a) change of venue, which is based on convenience rather than a mistake in filing location.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Venue in Removal Cases</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">When an action is removed from state court, it is transferred to the federal district court geographically encompassing the state court where the action was originally pending. The federal venue rules do not apply to the initial choice of the federal forum in removal cases, as it is determined by the location of the state court.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff files a lawsuit against a defendant in a state court for a case involving a federal question. The defendant, believing that the case should be heard in federal court due to the federal question involved, files a notice of removal. The case is then removed from the state court to the federal district court that covers the same geographic area as the state court where the action was initiated. In this situation, the federal venue rules regarding the appropriate location for the federal court are not applicable because the venue is automatically set by the geographic location of the state court from which the case was removed.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Relation to Subject-Matter and Personal Jurisdiction</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">While related, venue is distinct from subject-matter jurisdiction, which relates to a court&rsquo;s power to hear the type of case, and personal jurisdiction, which addresses a court&apos;s power over the parties involved. The venue is primarily about the specific judicial district in which the litigation takes place. It&rsquo;s possible for a court to have both subject-matter and personal jurisdiction but be an improper venue.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Kyle files a patent infringement lawsuit against Dynamic Widgets Inc. in the Eastern District of Texas. The Eastern District of Texas has subject-matter jurisdiction because patent infringement is a federal question. It has personal jurisdiction over Dynamic Widgets Inc. because the company regularly conducts business in Texas. However, since all the alleged acts of infringement occurred in the Northern District of California, where Dynamic Widgets Inc. is headquartered and the key witnesses and evidence are located, the Eastern District of Texas may be an improper venue. Dynamic Widgets Inc. can move to transfer the case to the Northern District of California, arguing that the venue in Texas is improper despite the court&apos;s subject-matter and personal jurisdiction.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>





<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">State-Federal Disputes</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Disputes between state and federal law can happen any time state claims are presented in federal court, which occurs in supplemental and diversity jurisdiction cases. There are two types of federal law that can be involved in these disputes: statutory law, which comprises all written, formal laws such as the constitution and the FRCP, and common law, which comprises the body of court rulings, judicial interpretations, and legal precedents established by judicial decisions over time (the &lsquo;customs&rsquo; and &lsquo;habits&rsquo; of the federal court).</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a civil case, a plaintiff from State A sues a defendant from State B in federal court invoking diversity jurisdiction over a breach of contract claim and includes a related state law tort claim under supplemental jurisdiction. During the proceedings, a dispute arises regarding the statute of limitations. The state law prescribes a three-year statute of limitations for the tort claim, whereas the federal court, applying its own common law derived from judicial interpretations, typically enforces a four-year statute of limitations for similar claims. Since this is a diversity case, the federal court must apply the state&apos;s substantive law, including the three-year statute of limitations, to the state law claim to avoid any discrepancy that would arise from applying a different federal common law rule. Nonetheless, if procedural matters are in question, such as the format and timing of filing documents, the federal court would apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a statutory law that governs such matters in federal courts.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">State Law vs Statutory Law</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Pursuant to the decision made in Hanna v. Plumer (1965), in disputes between state law and statutory law, the statutory law will apply as long as it is constitutional and complies with the Rules Enabling Act (REA). In practice, federal statutes are typically presumed to be constitutionally sound and in compliance with the REA, rendering challenges to their validity uncommon.</span></h4>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a federal court, a plaintiff sues a defendant over a contract dispute. The state law requires service of process to be made directly to the defendant in person, while the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow service to be made to someone of suitable age at the defendant&apos;s dwelling. The defendant lives in a state that adheres strictly to their personal service laws for state cases. The plaintiff, following federal procedure, serves the defendant&rsquo;s spouse at their shared residence. The defendant moves to dismiss the case based on improper service of process, arguing that the state law should apply. Under the principles established in Hanna v. Plumer, the federal court applies the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the service of process, since these rules are constitutional and in line with the REA. The defendant&apos;s motion to dismiss on grounds of improper service is denied, as the federal statutory law prevails over the conflicting state law in federal court proceedings.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">State Law vs Common Law</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Pursuant to the decision made in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938), in disputes between state law and federal common law, the state law will apply if it is a substantive issue, and the common law will apply if it is a procedural issue. A substantive issue pertains to the rights and duties of the parties involved, while a procedural issue involves the methods and means by which cases are moved forward within the courts. Common examples of substantive issues include: the statute of limitations, damages, burden of proof, and elements of a claim or defense. Common examples of procedural issues include: issues involving class actions, judge vs jury determinations, and deciding whether a court can bifurcate a case. When the court cannot decide whether to use state law or federal common law for a particular issue, the Erie Doctrine outlines a 2 step analysis to clear up the ambiguity.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Step 1: Predetermined Areas</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">If there is no relevant federal procedural law, the court must determine whether the issue falls within an area that has been previously identified as substantive. The Supreme Court has explicitly declared four areas as substantive, meaning they constitute key legal principles that could significantly affect the outcome of a case. These areas are: (1) the elements of a claim or defense, which outline what a plaintiff needs to prove or a defendant needs to refute; (2) the statute of limitations, which sets the time limit within which a lawsuit must be filed; (3) rules for tolling the statute of limitations, which define circumstances under which the deadline to file a lawsuit can be extended; and (4) conflict or choice of law rules, which determine which jurisdiction&apos;s laws apply when there&apos;s a dispute involving multiple jurisdictions. If an issue in a case falls within any of these substantive areas, a federal court will apply state substantive law to decide the issue.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a case before a federal court, Kyle sues Dynamic Widgets Inc., a company based in State A, for breach of contract, which allegedly occurred in State B. Due to the diversity of citizenship, the federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction. As Kyle is a resident of State B and the breach occurred there, he argues that according to State B&apos;s laws, he has six years to file the lawsuit (statute of limitations), and he filed within this period. However, Dynamic Widgets Inc. contends that State A&apos;s three-year statute of limitations should apply, where the time would have expired. The federal court must apply State B&apos;s six-year statute of limitations because statutes of limitations are considered substantive law. Additionally, Kyle claims that even if State A&apos;s law applied, the statute should be tolled because he was out of the country on military service, which State B&apos;s rules for tolling acknowledge as an exception. Since rules for tolling statute limitations are also substantive, the federal court would apply State B&apos;s tolling provisions. Furthermore, if there was a dispute over whether State A&apos;s contract laws or State B&apos;s should govern the contract&apos;s interpretation, the federal court would use conflict of law rules to determine the applicable substantive law. If Kyle failed to directly address a core element of his breach of contract claim, the court would also apply the substantive law of the appropriate state to define the elements required to prove his case. In each of these circumstances, despite the case being in federal court, state law would guide decisions on these substantive matters.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Step 2: Balancing Interests</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The &quot;outcome-determinative&quot; test asks whether a state rule&apos;s application or disregard would significantly alter the case result. If it would, the rule is substantive. This test originated from Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, leading to precedent that federal courts honor state laws that significantly affect case outcomes. Subsequent cases, including Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, introduced a balancing test that compares federal and state interests when deciding whether to use a state&apos;s substantive law. The courts also examine if using a federal rule would significantly alter case outcomes, which might lead to uneven administration or forum shopping &mdash; the two events the Erie Doctrine seeks to avoid.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a negligence case filed in federal court, Heather, from State A, sues Patrick, a resident of State B, after a car accident in State A. State A&apos;s law imposes a shorter statute of limitations for negligence claims than the federal statute. Under the &quot;outcome-determinative&quot; test, the federal court must apply State A&apos;s statute of limitations because applying the federal rule would extend the time Heather has to sue, significantly altering the outcome of the case. On the other hand, the federal court decides procedural matters like the standard for jury selection based on the federal court&apos;s own rules, after determining that applying State A&apos;s potentially different jury selection standards would not significantly alter the outcome of the case and that federal interests in managing its courtrooms prevail, considering Byrd&apos;s balancing test. The court&apos;s decision ensures that the substantive right&mdash;the time limit to file a negligence claim&mdash;is consistently applied as it would be in State A&apos;s courts, preventing &quot;forum shopping,&quot; while maintaining federal procedural integrity.&nbsp;</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">State Law vs State Law</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">When a lawsuit encompasses multiple states, identifying the applicable state law for each substantive matter is crucial. The choice of law rules &mdash; which the Supreme Court has previously classified as substantive &mdash; dictate this process, meaning the court will apply the choice of law rules of the state where it is located. Choice of law rules are principles that determine which jurisdiction&apos;s laws are to be applied in a legal dispute, such as a law that says that all battery claims are to be governed by the laws of the state in which the victim is domiciled.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff domiciled in State X files a lawsuit in a federal court located in State Y against a defendant domiciled in State Z. The lawsuit includes claims for breach of contract, which occurred in State Z, and battery, which occurred in State X. The federal court must apply the choice of law rules of State Y, where the court is located, to determine which state&apos;s substantive law should govern each claim. According to State Y&apos;s choice of law rules, breach of contract issues are governed by the law of the place where the contract was to be performed, which is State Z, and battery claims are to be governed by the laws of the state where the injury occurred, which is State X. Therefore, the federal court will apply State Z&apos;s law to the breach of contract claim and State X&apos;s law to the battery claim, adhering to the choice of law principles of State Y.</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A TRO is a short-term emergency order aimed at immediate relief to prevent imminent and irreparable harm before a preliminary injunction hearing can take place. These orders are often granted with limited notice to the opposing party and, under Rule 65(b), can be issued without the opposing party being present (ex parte). TROs last for 14 days under Rule 65(b)(2), but can be extended for a maximum of another 14 days if the party against whom the TRO is directed does not appear at a hearing.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Kyle discovers that his former business partner Lara is planning to launch a marketing campaign using the company&apos;s trade secrets, which would significantly diminish their value. Kyle seeks a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to stop Lara&apos;s actions immediately, demonstrating that if the campaign goes public before a court can hold a preliminary injunction hearing, the harm to the company&apos;s competitive edge would be both imminent and irreparable. Citing Rule 65(b), Kyle requests the court to issue the TRO without notice to Lara due to the urgency, arguing any delay would result in substantial loss. The court, convinced of the potential immediate damage and the need for urgent relief, grants the TRO ex parte to preserve the status quo until the injunction hearing is held.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Requirements for TRO Without Notice</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">To issue a TRO without notifying the opposing party, the moving party must provide specific facts in a written affidavit or verified complaint clearly showing that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result before the adverse party can be heard. Additionally, the moving party must certify in writing any efforts made to give notice and the reasons why it should not be required.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Kyle&apos;s company has developed sensitive trade secrets for a new technology. He discovers that a former employee, Larry, plans to disclose these secrets at an industry conference tomorrow. Kyle files for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent Larry from revealing the information. In his affidavit, Kyle specifies the immediate and irreparable harm that his company will suffer if the trade secrets are disclosed, including the loss of competitive advantage and the devaluation of years of research. Kyle also submits a written certification detailing his attempts to notify Larry and explaining that further attempts would be futile and could compromise the confidentiality of the trade secrets before the court can act. The clear demonstration of potential harm and the detailed efforts made to notify Larry satisfy the requirements for a TRO to be issued without prior notice to Larry.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Preliminary Injunctions</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A preliminary injunction is an order granted at the beginning of a lawsuit which prevents the parties from taking certain actions during the litigation. To secure a preliminary injunction, the moving party must demonstrate: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in their favor (the harm that the defendant would suffer if the preliminary injunction was wrongly granted is less than the harm the plaintiff would suffer if it was wrongly not granted), and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Kyle, an inventor of a unique smartphone accessory, sues Gadget Corp., a large manufacturer, alleging that they are producing a copycat product. Kyle seeks a preliminary injunction to stop Gadget Corp. from selling the infringing product. He demonstrates to the court that he&apos;s likely to win the case on its merits due to his well-documented patent. Kyle also shows that he will suffer irreparable harm, as the continued sale of the product will cause a loss of market share and damage to his reputation that cannot be compensated by money alone. Moreover, he argues that the balance of equities favors him because the injunction would only pause Gadget Corp.&apos;s sales, whereas Kyle&apos;s business faces the threat of extinction without the injunction. Lastly, Kyle points out that upholding patent rights through an injunction serves the public interest by encouraging innovation. The court agrees and grants the preliminary injunction.</span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Filing a Complaint</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A complaint is the principal document that begins a lawsuit and outlines the plaintiff&apos;s case against the defendant. In the complaint, the plaintiff must concisely articulate their cause of action, showing a clear basis for why relief should be granted. The complaint must include a demand for judgment, specifying what the plaintiff is seeking, and a statement of the grounds that establish the court&apos;s subject matter jurisdiction over the case.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff files a complaint against a defendant for breach of contract, claiming the defendant failed to pay for goods delivered. The complaint details the date the contract was signed, the agreed terms, the delivery of goods, and the defendant&apos;s subsequent failure to pay the agreed amount. The plaintiff specifies seeking monetary damages of $50,000 and cites diversity jurisdiction as the basis for subject matter jurisdiction, with the plaintiff and defendant being citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeding $75,000. Additionally, the complaint includes all relevant contract clauses and evidence of delivery to solidify the cause of action.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Notice Pleadings</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Notice pleadings are the more common, and default, form of pleading. A notice pleading must include sufficient factual assertions to make a claim for relief plausible, rather than merely possible. It should clearly convey to the defendant the essence of the claim being asserted against them.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a lawsuit where a plaintiff sues a defendant for breach of contract, the plaintiff&rsquo;s complaint briefly states that the defendant failed to deliver goods by the agreed-upon date and that this failure caused the plaintiff financial harm. The complaint outlines the basic terms of the contract, the expected date of delivery, the date when the goods were actually received, and the economic impact of this delay on the plaintiff&rsquo;s business operations. This complaint is an example of notice pleading, as it provides sufficient facts to make the claim for breach of contract plausible, not just possible. It informs the defendant of the essence of the claim: the alleged breach (failure to deliver on time) and resulting damages, thus allowing the defendant to prepare an adequate defense.In a lawsuit where a plaintiff sues a defendant for breach of contract, the plaintiff&rsquo;s complaint briefly states that the defendant failed to deliver goods by the agreed-upon date and that this failure caused the plaintiff financial harm.

</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Fact Pleadings</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">For allegations involving fraud, mistake, or special damages&mdash;which are particularized to the plaintiff and not generally a consequence of the defendant&apos;s conduct&mdash;the rules demand a more detailed level of pleading: the fact pleading. This entails explicit articulation of the circumstances, specifying the involved parties, the actions taken, the locations, times, and the underlying reasons for the claims.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a lawsuit where the plaintiff accuses the defendant, a real estate agent, of fraudulently misrepresenting the condition of a property, the plaintiff must use fact pleading to provide specifics. The plaintiff details that the defendant claimed the property had new plumbing during a showing on June 1, 2023, at the property&apos;s location, when in fact the plumbing was over ten years old and in disrepair, causing significant unexpected costs immediately after purchase. The pleading must include particulars such as the date of the property showing, the exact statements made by the real estate agent, the actual state of the plumbing, and the resulting damages the plaintiff faced due to the defendant&apos;s misrepresentations to satisfy the heightened requirement of fact pleading in cases of fraud.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Defendant&apos;s Response Options</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs the defendant&apos;s response options:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A motion to address procedural issues or to dismiss the case on various grounds, such as lack of jurisdiction or failure to state a claim.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">An answer to respond to the plaintiff&apos;s allegations by admitting, denying, stating a lack of sufficient information to admit or deny, and asserting affirmative defenses.</span></p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Responsive Motions under Rule 12</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Defendants may file several types of motions under Rule 12:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 12(b) motions covering defenses from lack of jurisdiction to failure to join an indispensable party.</span></p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a contract dispute, the defendant files a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing the federal court does not have the authority to decide the case. Concurrently, the defendant files a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the complaint lacks sufficient detail to suggest a plausible entitlement to relief. Lastly, the defendant submits a Rule 12(b)(7) motion to dismiss for failure to join an indispensable party, claiming that a joint contractor who is not part of the lawsuit has interests that will be significantly affected by the case&rsquo;s outcome. Each motion addresses a separate defense that must be considered by the court before the merits of the case can be addressed.</span></p>
    </li>

    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 12(c) motions for judgment on the pleadings, applicable when the case can be decided based on the pleadings alone.</span></p>

<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a dispute between a homeowner and a construction company, the homeowner files a complaint alleging that the construction company failed to build their house according to the agreed specifications. The construction company responds with an answer denying the allegations and asserting that the house was built to the exact specifications. After the pleadings are closed, the construction company believes that the facts presented by the homeowner in the complaint, even if taken as true, do not establish a legal claim for breach of contract. The company files a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the court can decide the case based solely on the content of the pleadings. In this motion, the construction company asserts that the homeowner&apos;s pleadings fail to show that there was any deviation from the contract&apos;s specifications, and therefore, there is no basis for a breach of contract claim. The court reviews the pleadings and determines if there are sufficient facts to rule in favor of one party without the need for further evidence or trial.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 12(e) motions for a more definite statement if the defendant cannot reasonably prepare a response due to vague allegations.</span></p>

</ol>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Defendant is served with a complaint by Plaintiff alleging negligence on the part of Defendant in maintaining a public walkway, but the complaint lacks specific details regarding the time and location of the alleged incident. Defendant, unable to reasonably prepare a response or defense because of these vague allegations, files a Rule 12(e) motion for a more definite statement to clarify the time and place of the incident. The court grants the motion, obligating Plaintiff to file an amended complaint with the required specificity. If, on the other hand, Plaintiff&rsquo;s complaint had specified that Defendant&rsquo;s negligence occurred on &quot;January 1st at 123 Main Street,&quot; providing Defendant with sufficient information, a Rule 12(e) motion would likely be denied as Defendant can reasonably prepare a response to the allegations as they are not vague.</span></p>

<ol start="4">
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 12(f) motions to strike redundant or immaterial portions of the pleadings.</span></p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff files a lawsuit against a defendant for breach of contract, including an extensive history of their prior dealings in the complaint. The defendant, believing that these historical details are not relevant to the actual breach of contract claim, files a Rule 12(f) motion to strike the immaterial portions of the pleadings to focus the litigation on the actual dispute of contract breach. The court grants the motion, deeming the extensive background information as redundant and immaterial to the core legal issue. On a separate claim within the same lawsuit, the plaintiff alleges defamation by the defendant. The complaint contains a statement made by the defendant that is repeated multiple times. The defendant files a Rule 12(f) motion to strike the repeated statement as redundant. However, the court denies this motion because the repetition in this context is not considered redundant to the point of being immaterial; rather, it serves to emphasize the alleged harm caused by the defamatory statement.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Admissions, Denials, and Affirmative Defenses</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In an answer, the defendant can admit or deny each of the plaintiff&apos;s assertions. If the defendant lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation, they may state so, which operates as a denial. The answer is also where defendants raise affirmative defenses such as waiver and consent, providing reasons the plaintiff&apos;s claim should not succeed even if the allegations are true.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a suit alleging breach of contract, the defendant&apos;s answer denies the plaintiff&apos;s assertion that a valid contract existed, stating that there was no mutual agreement on the terms. In another allegation where the plaintiff claims they performed all necessary obligations under the contract, the defendant admits to the plaintiff&apos;s completion of some obligations but denies others, specifying which actions were not performed as required. For an allegation concerning the amount of damages, the defendant indicates they lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the claim, which operates as a denial. Additionally, the defendant raises the affirmative defense of consent, claiming the plaintiff agreed to the actions taken by the defendant, which, if true, would negate the plaintiff&rsquo;s claim. The defendant also asserts the affirmative defense of waiver, alleging the plaintiff knowingly relinquished their right to seek breach of contract remedies.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Right to Amend</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Both parties to a lawsuit can amend their pleadings once as a matter of course, but any subsequent amendments require either the other party&rsquo;s consent or the court&rsquo;s permission (leave of court). Under FRCP 15(a)(1), a party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course within (1) 21 days after serving it, or (2) if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required, 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a motion, whichever is earlier. Any amendment beyond these timeframes or after amending once as a matter of course requires the opposing party&apos;s consent or the court&apos;s leave. If an amendment would cause prejudice to the opposing party, the court may deny leave to amend. Prejudice might occur if an amendment adds completely new claims or defenses significantly altering the nature of litigation or requires the opponent to expend significant additional resources to conduct discovery and prepare for trial. Additionally, if the amended complaint would not survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, it is considered futile, and the court is justified in denying leave to amend.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff files a complaint against a defendant alleging negligence. Within 21 days of serving the complaint, the plaintiff decides to amend the complaint to clarify certain details about the alleged negligence, which is permissible as a matter of course under FRCP 15(a)(1). The defendant then files an answer, and within 21 days of this responsive pleading, chooses to amend their answer to include an additional affirmative defense of contributory negligence, also as a matter of course. Two months later, the plaintiff seeks to amend the complaint a second time to add a new claim for breach of contract, which arose from the same facts but was not previously included. As this falls outside the initial 21-day window and constitutes a second amendment, the plaintiff requires either the defendant&apos;s consent or leave of court to amend the pleading. The defendant objects to the amendment on the grounds of prejudice, arguing that adding a breach of contract claim would significantly change the nature of the litigation and cause undue delay. The plaintiff must now seek the court&apos;s permission, and the court will consider whether the new claim would prejudice the defendant by requiring additional discovery and potentially altering the trial strategy. Alternatively, if the plaintiff tries to add a claim that is clearly barred by the statute of limitations, the defendant can argue that the amendment is futile because the claim would be subject to an immediate motion to dismiss. The court may deny the amendment on this basis, as it would not be able to withstand a motion to dismiss and therefore does not serve a legitimate purpose in the litigation.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Relation Back Under Rule 15(c)(1)(B)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In cases where the plaintiff wants to amend their complaint after the Statute of Limitations (SOL) expires, the amendment will only stand if it relates back to the original pleading. Amendments that add or change a claim or defense are subject to Rule 15(c)(1)(B). Under this rule, changing a pleading is treated as if it happened with the original document if the change arises from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as the original claim.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff files a lawsuit against a defendant for breach of contract within the appropriate statute of limitations period. Following the expiration of the statute of limitations, the plaintiff seeks to amend their complaint to include a claim for fraud based on the same set of facts involving the contract. Additionally, the plaintiff wishes to add a claim of negligent misrepresentation unrelated to the contract breach. The court allows the amendment for the fraud claim, as it arises from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out in the original pleading&mdash;namely, the contractual relationship and actions between the parties. This amendment relates back to the date of the original complaint under Rule 15(c)(1)(B). However, the court does not allow the amendment for negligent misrepresentation since this claim does not share the same factual basis as the breach of contract claim; it does not arise from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence, and thus, cannot relate back to the original filing.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Relation Back Under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In the context of amendments made after the SOL expires, amendments that change a party, change the name of a party, or add a new party are subject to Rule 15(c)(1)(C). Under this rule, changing a pleading is treated as if it happened with the original document if:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The change arises from the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as the original claim</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Within 120 days after the original filing, the person to be changed or added must (1) have notice such that they will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits, and (2) know or should have known that they would have been named in the original pleading but for a mistake on the plaintiff&rsquo;s part.</span></p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a real estate dispute, the plaintiff originally sues a real estate agent for negligence during the sale of a house. Within the time limits set by the law, the plaintiff realizes that the complaint should have named the real estate agency, not just the agent. The plaintiff amends the pleading to include the agency as a defendant. This amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading because it concerns the same transaction and occurrence. Under Rule 15(c)(1)(C), the real estate agency was aware of the lawsuit soon after it was filed due to its communication with the agent, and it knew or should have known that, but for the plaintiff&apos;s error, it would have been named originally. Therefore, the amendment changing the party defendant is treated as having been filed with the original pleading, and the agency cannot claim prejudice in its defense.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Supplemental Pleadings</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under FRCP 15(d), upon a party&rsquo;s motion, the court may allow a party to serve a supplemental pleading to address any transaction, occurrence, or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented. Supplemental pleadings are used for including events that change the original circumstances of the case or that are necessary for the party&apos;s claims or defenses. The court, considering the efficiency and appropriateness of allowing the supplemental matter into the case, may require the opponent&apos;s consent or may impose conditions for the filing of supplemental pleadings.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff sues Defendant for breach of contract after Defendant fails to deliver goods by the agreed-upon date of March 1st. The plaintiff&apos;s initial complaint outlines the details of the contract and the failure to deliver. In April, Defendant delivers some but not all of the goods, altering the extent of the breach. Plaintiff files a motion under FRCP 15(d) to serve a supplemental pleading to update the complaint with these new developments, which bear on the original claim. The court grants the motion, recognizing that the delivery partially changes the circumstances of the case and is necessary for Plaintiff&apos;s claim. However, Defendant commences related business with a third party in May, potentially affecting the lawsuit further. Plaintiff seeks to file another supplemental pleading to reflect this new transaction. The court, aiming to manage the case efficiently, may allow the supplemental pleading with conditions such as a deadline to ensure the case progresses without undue delay or may require Defendant&rsquo;s consent if it finds that the new facts are not as closely related to the original claim.</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Purpose of Rule 11</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 11&apos;s primary intention is to deter parties and attorneys from filing lawsuits, motions, and other papers that are frivolous, legally unreasonable, without factual foundation, or brought for an improper purpose such as to harass. It is not designed to stifle legitimate advocacy or chill an attorney&apos;s enthusiasm or creativity in pursuing factual or legal theories.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Representations to the Court</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under Rule 11, when submitting a pleading, written motion, or other paper to the court, an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances: (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and (4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.</span></p>

    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The complaint is not filed to harass Defendant or cause unnecessary delay but seeks legitimate legal redress for the property damage;</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The claim is based on a current and applicable negligence law, and the attorney believes that the law supports the Plaintiff&apos;s position. There is no frivolous argument presented, and the claim is not meant to extend or modify existing law in an unreasonable manner;</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The factual allegations about the negligent construction and resulting landslide are supported by preliminary evidence like expert opinions and eyewitness accounts. The attorney also indicates that, with further discovery, additional supporting evidence - such as construction records and soil analysis - will likely be found;</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Should Defendant deny the allegations, the attorney has ensured that such denials will be made in good faith, based on evidence such as Defendant&rsquo;s records showing adherence to safety protocols. If Plaintiff lacks certain information, any denial would be based on a reasonable belief rather than an attempt to obscure facts.</span></p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&nbsp;In another instance, Defendant files a counterclaim accusing Plaintiff of contributory negligence for failing to maintain their property, knowing construction was happening nearby. The attorney certifies that this defense is not meant to unjustly blame Plaintiff but is a legitimate argument under the law&apos;s allowance for contributory negligence defenses. Moreover, the attorney has some evidence, like communications where Plaintiff acknowledges the construction, to support this claim, and anticipates further evidence could be found with additional discovery. The counterclaim adheres to Rule 11 because it is not frivolous, is supported by some evidence, and is not intended to harass or increase litigation costs.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Sanctions From Motions</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The process for imposing sanctions usually begins with a motion for sanctions, filed by the opposing party. Rule 11 includes a &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision, where a sanctions motion cannot be filed with or presented to the court unless the opposing party is first served personally with the motion. The party potentially in violation then has 21 days to withdraw or appropriately correct the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial. If the violation is not corrected within this safe harbor period, the motion may be presented in court.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A defendant believes that the plaintiff&rsquo;s lawsuit is frivolous and violates Rule 11 because it lacks factual evidence and is not warranted by existing law. Before filing a motion for sanctions against the plaintiff, the defendant&apos;s attorney serves the motion on the plaintiff&apos;s attorney personally, providing the plaintiff with a 21-day safe harbor period to withdraw the complaint. The plaintiff reviews the claim and realizes that the legal basis is indeed flawed. Within the 21-day period, the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses the lawsuit, thus avoiding the sanctions motion being filed with the court. If the plaintiff had not dismissed the complaint within the 21-day safe harbor period, the defendant could then present the motion for sanctions to the court for consideration.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Sua Sponte Sanctions</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A court has the authority to initiate Rule 11 sanctions sua sponte, meaning it can impose sanctions on its own accord without a motion from another party. When sanctions are raised sua sponte, the court is not obligated to provide the 21-day safe harbor provision, which typically allows the sanctioned party an opportunity to withdraw or correct the problematic filing. These sanctions are typically used to address issues such as contempt of court, filing frivolous lawsuits for the purpose of harassing the defendant, improper behavior by attorneys or parties in court, or failure to comply with procedural rules.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">During a complex business litigation, the plaintiff alleges multiple claims against the defendant, including some that appear to lack a factual basis. During proceedings, the court notices that the plaintiff&apos;s claims are not only frivolous but also that the allegations seem to have been made with an intent to harass the defendant. Recognizing that these actions are a violation of Rule 11, which prohibits parties from filing frivolous claims, the court decides to initiate Rule 11 sanctions sua sponte. Because the court is acting on its own initiative, it does not provide the plaintiff with a 21-day safe harbor period to withdraw the problematic claims. The court issues an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed. The plaintiff, therefore, faces the possibility of penalties including fines, an order to pay the defendant&apos;s attorney&apos;s fees, or other disciplinary actions deemed appropriate by the court, all without the chance to first rectify the improper filings that prompted the sanctions.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Applicability to Pro Se Litigants</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 11 applies to attorneys and to parties who represent themselves (pro se litigants). However, courts are often more lenient with pro se litigants, considering their typical lack of legal training.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">During a civil lawsuit, the defendant, who is representing themselves pro se, submits a series of motions that lack a factual basis and are not grounded in legal reasoning. Noticing this, the court decides to address the potential violation of Rule 11, which requires all filings to be well-grounded in fact and warranted by existing law or a non-frivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law. In comparison, an attorney representing a client in a similar case files a motion based on a deliberate misinterpretation of the facts and unsupported legal claims. In both scenarios, Rule 11 sanctions may be considered. However, the court recognizes the pro se litigant&apos;s lack of legal expertise and may provide guidance on proper procedure before imposing any sanctions. For the attorney, the court expects a higher standard of conduct and may more readily impose sanctions after a Rule 11 violation without providing additional leeway.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>





<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Joinder of Parties</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Joinder of parties in civil litigation is a critical concept that ensures the efficient administration of justice by allowing parties with legal interests connected by common questions of law or fact to be joined in one lawsuit. This consolidation promotes judicial economy, avoids duplication of litigation, and prevents inconsistent verdicts.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff, an individual, sues Defendant, a corporation, for product liability, claiming that a manufacturing defect in Defendant&apos;s product caused Plaintiff physical harm. For now, the only parties are Plaintiff and Defendant, and the only claim is product liability. It can get complicated, however.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Permissive Joinder of Parties</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 20 allows the joinder of multiple plaintiffs or defendants in a single action if: (1) they assert claims that arise out of the same transaction or occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and (2) there are common questions of law or fact to the claims. The court must also have subject matter and personal jurisdiction over all parties. The rule&apos;s purpose is to promote trial convenience and expedite the resolution of disputes that have similar factual and legal issues.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff, after suing Defendant for product liability, discovers that several other individuals suffered similar harm from the same product defect. Plaintiff moves to amend the complaint to include these additional plaintiffs. The court allows this permissive joinder because the claims arise from the same series of transactions &mdash; the sale of defective products &mdash; and present common questions of law, such as the standard of care owed by the Defendant, and fact, such as the nature of the defect.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Compulsory Joinder of Parties</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 19 establishes the criteria for when certain parties must be joined if feasible. A party is necessary and must be joined if: (1) in their absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; (2) the absent party claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person&rsquo;s absence may impede the party&apos;s ability to protect that interest; or (3) the proceeding of the case without the party would leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">While the lawsuit progresses, Plaintiff&rsquo;s spouse claims loss of consortium due to the injuries Plaintiff suffered. The court determines that the spouse should be joined compulsorily because not including the spouse might prevent the court from granting complete relief to Plaintiff, as any award to Plaintiff could be incomplete without consideration of the spouse&apos;s separate but related damages.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Impleader</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Impleader, under Rule 14, allows a defending party to bring a new party (the &quot;third-party defendant&quot;) into the lawsuit if that third party may be liable for all or part of the plaintiff&rsquo;s claim against the defending party. This procedure is used for claims of indemnity or contribution, and must be done within 14 days after the answer or later if the court grants permission. There are no compulsory impleaders.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Defendant, upon being sued for product liability, files a third-party complaint against Manufacturer (who manufactured the products in question), alleging that if Defendant is found liable, Manufacturer should indemnify Defendant for the faulty components. This impleader brings Manufacturer into the lawsuit as a third-party defendant because Manufacturer&apos;s actions may have directly caused the defect leading to Plaintiff&rsquo;s harm.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Intervention</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 24 establishes the right of a non-party to intervene in an ongoing lawsuit. The non-party can intervene as of right if a federal statute confers an unconditional right or the non-party has a significant legal interest that may be impaired if not allowed to intervene (known as intervention as a matter of right). Alternatively, the court may permit intervention if the non-party has a claim or defense with a question of law or fact in common with the main action (known as permissive intervention).</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A real estate agent, hearing of the lawsuit, seeks to intervene. The agent sold the property where Plaintiff&apos;s injuries occurred, which included the defective product as a fixture, and could be subject to liability if the product&apos;s danger was known and not disclosed. Since his interests could be affected by the outcome of the current litigation, the court may allow him to intervene to protect his interests.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Interpleader</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 22 governs interpleader, which allows a party holding property (the &quot;stakeholder&quot;) to initiate a lawsuit to compel two or more other parties who claim that property to litigate their claims against each other and thereby relieve the stakeholder from liability. The stakeholder can also be a claimant.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The Plaintiff&apos;s lawsuit against the Defendant for product liability is ongoing when a dispute arises between Defendant&apos;s insurer and a secondary insurer over which policy covers the liability for the defective product that caused harm. To resolve the dispute and ascertain its own obligations, Defendant uses an interpleader action to force the two insurers to litigate against each other to determine which insurer is responsible for covering the claim, thereby seeking relief from conflicting claims against the same insurance proceeds.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Joinder of Claims</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 18 allows a party to join as many claims as they have against an opposing party. This means a plaintiff can sue a defendant on multiple counts, irrespective of whether they are related, and a defendant can counterclaim against a plaintiff with unrelated claims. The purpose is to settle all disputes between the parties in a single judicial proceeding.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Counterclaims and Crossclaims</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The defendant may assert counterclaims against the plaintiff for any claims related to the same transaction or occurrence (compulsory counterclaims). Defendants must assert compulsory counterclaims, otherwise they lose their right to assert these claims in any other litigation. Defendants may also assert unrelated counterclaims (permissive counterclaims). Lastly, a defendant may assert claims against other defendants when there are multiple, known as crossclaims. The first crossclaim must arise from the same transaction or occurrence as the original claim, but then any subsequent crossclaims do not have to.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Meanwhile, the Defendant countersues Plaintiff for defamation, alleging that Plaintiff made false statements 6 months ago about the Defendant that damaged its reputation. This is a permissive counterclaim as it does not arise out of the same transaction&mdash; &nbsp;the sale of the defective product. The Defendant also asserts a crossclaim against the Manufacturer for any reputational damage caused by their faulty components, which could establish Manufacturer&apos;s liability to Defendant independent of Plaintiff&apos;s product liability claim.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Class Actions</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 23 provides for class actions where one or more plaintiffs sue on behalf of a larger group. This is allowed where the class is so numerous that joining all members is impracticable, there are questions of law or fact common to the class, the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff learns that the injury-causing defect in Defendant&apos;s product may have affected thousands. Plaintiff files a motion for class certification, aiming to represent all individuals who were injured by the Defendant&apos;s product. If the court finds that there are too many claimants for individual lawsuits, that common legal and factual questions prevail, that Plaintiff&apos;s claims are typical of the class, and that Plaintiff can adequately represent the class, it may certify the lawsuit as a class action.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Initial Requirements for Class Actions (CANT)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">For a lawsuit to proceed as a class action, it must satisfy four initial requirements, commonly abbreviated as &quot;CANT&quot;: Commonality, Adequacy of Representation, Numerosity, and Typicality. Commonality requires the class members to share at least one question of law or fact. Adequacy of Representation is where the representative adequately and fairly represents the class interests. Numerosity means the class is so large that individual lawsuits would be impractical. &nbsp;Typicality demands the class representative&apos;s claims or defenses be typical of those of the entire class. Courts can rectify representation issues by appointing more representatives or creating subclasses.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A group of 200 employees sues a large corporation claiming gender discrimination in promotion practices, which the employees argue has affected all female employees. The employees seek to proceed as a class action:</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Commonality:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The claim of gender discrimination in promotions is a common issue that all the female employees in the company could potentially face, fulfilling the commonality requirement.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Adequacy of Representation:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">One of the employees, a long-standing member of the company, who has been vocal about the unfair promotion practices, has been appointed as a representative. She has no conflicts of interest with the rest of the class and is working closely with a skilled attorney to represent the class&apos;s interests, satisfying the adequacy of representation requirement.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Numerosity:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Individually, it would be burdensome for each of the 200 employees to file and manage separate lawsuits against the corporation. The large number of potential plaintiffs makes a class action a more practical approach to address the collective grievances, meeting the numerosity requirement.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Typicality:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The representative&apos;s situation is similar to the rest of the class, as she has experienced the same discriminatory practice regarding promotions that the other female employees allege. Her claim is, therefore, typical of the class, meeting the typicality criterion.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&nbsp;Given these circumstances, the lawsuit is likely to proceed as a class action, but suppose issues arise with representation, such as the current representative later developing interests that conflict with the class, or if a subgroup of the employees has a unique claim. In that case, the court has the option to appoint additional representatives or create subclasses to ensure that the representation remains adequate and fair.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Class Action Categories</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Class actions must fit into one of three categories: Prejudice, Injunction or Declaratory Relief, and Damages. The Prejudice category applies when class treatment is required to avoid harming class members or the party opposing the class. Injunction or Declaratory Relief applies when the lawsuit seeks such relief rather than damages. The Damages category is used when common legal or factual questions predominate and a class action is superior for resolving the dispute.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A group of homeowners files a class-action lawsuit against a manufacturing company for environmental contamination that harmed their properties. The lawsuit falls into the Prejudice category because individual suits by homeowners might result in inconsistent judgments, and the manufacturing company could face the possibility of incompatible standards of conduct if each homeowner were required to sue separately. This type of class action is necessary to avoid prejudice against the class members and the defendant. Additionally, the lawsuit requests an injunction to stop the ongoing contamination and seeks declaratory relief to have the court declare the company&apos;s actions illegal. This places the lawsuit in the Injunction or Declaratory Relief category as it primarily seeks behavior modification rather than monetary damages. Lastly, considering the Damages category, the legal issue common to all class members &ndash; whether the company&apos;s actions were illegal &ndash; and the factual issue &ndash; whether those actions caused the property damage &ndash; predominate over any questions affecting individual members. Thus, a class action would be superior for resolving the dispute because it would be impractical and inefficient for hundreds of homeowners to pursue individual lawsuits, and the class action mechanism would allow for a single adjudication of liability.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Opt-Out Rights and Notifications in Damages Class Actions</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In damages class actions, the court must inform all identifiable class members about their right to opt out of the class action. Those who don&apos;t opt out are bound by the court&apos;s judgment. Class members have the right to appear separately with their own counsel. Notably, the cost of these notifications is borne by the class representative.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a class action lawsuit, a representative plaintiff sues on behalf of a class for damages related to a defective product. The court certifies the class and requires the plaintiff to send out notices to all identifiable class members. The notice explains the nature of the class action, the defined class they belong to, their right to opt out of the proceedings, and how they can opt out if they choose. It also notifies them that they won&apos;t be able to pursue an independent lawsuit regarding the claim if they don&apos;t opt out and that they will be bound by the court&apos;s judgment. Furthermore, the notice informs class members of their right to appear in the class action with their own attorney if they desire. The expenses associated with sending these notices are charged to the class representative or their counsel. After notices are sent, some class members decide to opt out to pursue individual claims, while others choose to remain in the class, some appointing separate counsel to represent their interests in the class action.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>





<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Scope of Discovery</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 26(b) sets the scope of discovery as any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party&apos;s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case. Information within this scope need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. The court must consider the importance of the issues at stake, the amount in controversy, the parties&apos; relative access to relevant information, the parties&apos; resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a patent infringement case, Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff to produce all emails from the past ten years relating to the technology in question. Plaintiff objects, arguing the request is overly broad and not proportional to the needs of the case. The court agrees with Plaintiff, noting that while the emails may be relevant, the ten-year scope is excessive, and the parties&apos; resources and the burden of reviewing such a vast amount of information outweigh the likely benefit. The court orders a more limited discovery period of three years, which more appropriately aligns with the technology&apos;s development timeline and the infringement claims at issue. Conversely, in a contract dispute where significant damages are claimed, and the key issue is whether Defendant was aware of certain contractual obligations, Plaintiff requests documents related to Defendant&apos;s internal training on contract procedures. Defendant claims these documents are irrelevant. However, the court finds the request falls within the scope of Rule 26(b) as the documents could show Defendant&apos;s understanding of contract obligations, which is relevant to the claim and proportional to the large amount in controversy. The information is also not readily accessible to Plaintiff, and the burden of producing these specific documents is not excessive for Defendant, who has more knowledge and control over the information. Thus, the court grants the motion to compel.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Protective Orders</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 26(c) allows a party or person from whom discovery is sought to move for a protective order to protect them from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. The court may forbid the discovery entirely, limit its scope, or prescribe certain terms for conducting the discovery. Protective orders can be issued at any point in discovery.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A defendant in a civil lawsuit moves for a protective order under Rule 26(c) to prevent the deposition of their expert witness, arguing that the plaintiff&apos;s demand for extensive background materials spanning over 20 years is unduly burdensome and constitutes harassment. The plaintiff counters this, claiming the materials are necessary to challenge the expert&apos;s credibility and methodology. The court grants the protective order, limiting the scope of discovery to the expert&apos;s materials directly related to the case at hand and specifies terms by allowing the deposition but with a restricted time frame and topic range. This protects the expert from undue burden while allowing the plaintiff to obtain relevant information.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Step 1: Initial Disclosures</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under FRCP 26(a)(1), parties are required to provide their opponents with initial disclosures without waiting for them to ask. This includes the names and contact information of individuals likely to have discoverable information, copies of all documents and electronically stored information that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, a computation of each category of damages claimed, and any insurance agreements that may be relevant for satisfying a possible judgment.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff initiates a lawsuit against a defendant for breach of contract, seeking damages for lost profits. As per FRCP 26(a)(1), the plaintiff automatically provides the defendant with the initial disclosures, including the names and contact information of the accountants who can attest to the lost profits, copies of emails and contracts to support the claim of breach, a detailed computation of the lost profits based on past sales figures, and the details of an insurance policy that may cover contract disputes. Concurrently, the defendant planning to argue that the breach was justified due to poor product quality from the plaintiff, automatically provides initial disclosures to the plaintiff. This includes the names and contact information of quality control experts, copies of quality reports and correspondence citing product issues, a computation of losses incurred due to the alleged poor product quality, and any insurance agreements that might cover the defendant&rsquo;s liability or losses stemming from the contract breach.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Step 2. Written Discovery</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">This is typically the first stage of formal discovery. It includes:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Interrogatories:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under Rule 33, a party may serve up to 25 written interrogatories (questions that one party sends to the other, which must be answered under oath) on any other party. Interrogatories are limited to parties in the lawsuit and cannot be posed to nonparties.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff files a lawsuit against a defendant for breach of contract. As part of the discovery process, the plaintiff serves the defendant with a set of 23 written interrogatories regarding the details of the contract, the defendant&rsquo;s performance, and any communications related to the breach. The defendant is expected to respond under oath to these interrogatories, which directly pertain to the involved parties and are within the allowable limit of 25 interrogatories as stated under Rule 33. Meanwhile, the plaintiff realizes that a nonparty, a supplier for the defendant, may have relevant information about the contractual obligations. However, since interrogatories can only be directed at parties to the lawsuit, the plaintiff instead considers using a different discovery tool, such as a subpoena, to obtain the necessary information from the nonparty supplier.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Requests for Production:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 34 allows a party to serve requests to produce documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things within the scope of discovery and for entry onto land for inspection and other purposes.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a property dispute, the plaintiff serves a Rule 34 request to the defendant, demanding the production of emails and contracts relevant to the land in question, as well as access to the property to conduct a survey and environmental inspection. The defendant must respond by either producing the requested documents and granting entry to the land for inspection or objecting to specific requests they feel are not within the scope of discovery.</span></p>

</ul>
<ol start="3">
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Requests for Admissions:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under Rule 36, a party may submit a statement of fact to the other party, asking them to admit or deny the truth of the statement or admit the genuineness of a document. These admissions are for the purpose of the pending action only and not for other purposes.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff in a civil lawsuit submits a Request for Admissions to the defendant under Rule 36, asking the defendant to admit that they were the driver of the vehicle involved in the traffic accident on a specific date. Additionally, the plaintiff requests the defendant to admit the genuineness of a contract that is central to the dispute. The defendant responds by admitting to being the driver at the specified time, thereby establishing that fact for the pending case without the need for further proof at trial. However, the defendant denies the genuineness of the contract, prompting the plaintiff to prove its validity through other evidence. These admissions and denials are strictly for the resolution of the particular lawsuit and do not have any bearing on other separate legal proceedings. The admitted facts simplify the issues for trial and provide clarity on what is still in contention.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Step 3: Depositions</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">FRCP 30 and 31 govern depositions by oral examination and written questions, respectively. A deposition involves an attorney questioning a witness or party to the case in the presence of the opposing attorney, but without a judge present. The transcript of the deposition can be used later in court. Depositions are typically limited to 10 depositions per side and a maximum duration of seven hours per deposition. Depositions are under oath, and the testimony is recorded for potential use in court proceedings.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff in a complex commercial litigation case seeks to depose a key witness, a former employee of the defendant company. This deposition is scheduled for one day, adhering to the seven-hour limit imposed by FRCP 30. During the deposition, the witness provides testimony under oath, which is recorded by a court reporter. The plaintiff&apos;s attorney carefully manages the time to ensure that the most critical questions are covered within this timeframe, aware that exceeding the duration could lead to objections and potential court intervention to enforce the time limit. In preparation for additional evidence gathering, the plaintiff considers deposing several other witnesses. However, mindful of the FRCP 30 rule that typically allows for only 10 depositions per side, the plaintiff&apos;s legal team carefully selects the most pertinent individuals to depose to maximize the impact of their limited deposition opportunities. Meanwhile, due to logistical issues, the plaintiff wishes to depose an expert witness residing in a foreign country. Since bringing the expert in for an oral deposition would be impractical, the plaintiff opts to depose the expert using written questions under FRCP 31. The plaintiff submits a set of questions to be answered in writing, under oath, and returned for potential use in the trial. This method allows the plaintiff to get the necessary testimony without the need for the expert&apos;s physical presence during an oral deposition.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Step 4: Physical and Mental Examinations</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In certain cases, one party may request that the other party undergo a physical or mental examination by a healthcare professional of their choosing. Rule 35 of the FRCP governs these examinations. The requesting party must demonstrate that the mental or physical condition of the opposing party is in controversy and relevant to the case. The results of these examinations can be used as evidence in the case.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A defendant in a personal injury lawsuit requests a court order under Rule 35 for the plaintiff to undergo a mental examination by a psychiatrist. The plaintiff has claimed significant mental anguish and emotional distress as a result of the defendant&apos;s alleged negligence. The defendant provides evidence that the plaintiff&apos;s mental condition is in controversy &ndash; specifically, the plaintiff&apos;s claim of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following the incident &ndash; and that it is relevant to the determination of damages in the case. The court agrees and orders the examination, whose results show mild anxiety but do not support the diagnosis of PTSD. The defendant introduces this evidence at trial to challenge the extent of the claimed emotional damages.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Step 5: Subpoenas</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">FRCP 45 outlines the usage of subpoenas, which are legal documents issued by a court to compel any non-party to produce documents or testimony relevant to a case. Failure to comply with a subpoena can result in penalties, including fines or imprisonment.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff in a contract dispute case wants testimony from a witness who has knowledge about the contract&apos;s drafting but is not a party to the litigation. The plaintiff obtains a subpoena under FRCP 45, directing the witness to appear for a deposition and bring relevant documents pertaining to the contract negotiations. The witness is obligated to comply with the subpoena by providing testimony and producing the requested documents. If the witness refuses to comply, the issuing court has the authority to impose sanctions, which could include fines or even imprisonment for contempt of court. Thus, the subpoena compels the non-party witness to contribute evidence to the case, while the potential penalties for non-compliance ensure adherence to the court&apos;s authority.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Step 6: Expert Discovery</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Expert witnesses are individuals who have specialized knowledge, training, or experience in a particular field, and who can provide an opinion on issues relevant to a case. Rule 26 of the FRCP governs expert discovery. If either party plans to use expert witnesses, they must disclose the identity of the expert, the expert&apos;s qualifications, and a summary of the expert&apos;s expected testimony. This disclosure must be made in a timely manner to allow the opposing party to prepare for cross-examination or to retain their own expert witness.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a medical malpractice lawsuit, the plaintiff claims that a surgeon&rsquo;s negligence during an operation led to severe complications. To support their case, the plaintiff plans to use a medical expert to testify about the standard of care expected of a surgeon and how it was breached in this case. Under Rule 26 of the FRCP, the plaintiff discloses the identity of a board-certified surgeon as their expert witness, along with a detailed summary of the surgeon&apos;s qualifications which include years of experience and specialized training in the same type of surgery at issue. Additionally, the plaintiff provides a written report prepared by the expert, which outlines the expected testimony, including an opinion that the defendant deviated from the standard of care. On the other hand, the defendant also intends to present expert testimony to contradict the plaintiff&apos;s claims. The defendant discloses the identity of another highly qualified medical expert, whose credentials include a renowned medical practice and teaching position at a university medical school. The defendant&apos;s expert is expected to testify that the defendant&apos;s actions were consistent with the standard of care and that the complications experienced by the plaintiff were due to an unforeseeable allergic reaction. Both disclosures are made within the timeframes specified by the court, allowing each party sufficient time to analyze and prepare for depositions and potential cross-examination of the opposing party&apos;s expert. This timely exchange of information is vital for the fair and efficient adjudication of the case.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Step 7: Discovery Motions</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Disputes over discovery can arise during the discovery process. For example, one party may refuse to provide requested information, or may object to the scope or method of discovery. In such cases, the parties can file motions with the court asking for a ruling. Rule 37 of the FRCP governs discovery motions. The court may issue an order compelling discovery, imposing sanctions, or providing other relief as appropriate. Outlined below are the approaches for the different types of violations that can occur.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a civil lawsuit involving allegations of patent infringement, the defendant&apos;s failure to provide key design documents prompts the plaintiff to file a motion to compel discovery under Rule 37. The court grants the motion, orders the defendant to produce the documents, and warns that failure to comply could lead to sanctions. Subsequently, the defendant continues to withhold the documents, leading the plaintiff to file a second motion. This time, the court exercises its authority under Rule 37 and issues sanctions against the defendant: monetary fines for the plaintiff&rsquo;s legal expenses incurred due to the defendant&apos;s non-compliance and an order to prevent the defendant from using any undisclosed documents to support their case during the trial.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Three-Step Approach to Sanctions for Partial Violations</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">When a party partially complies with discovery obligations but unlawfully objects to other aspects, there is a structured approach to imposing sanctions:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Meet and Confer Obligation:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Litigants are required to make a good faith effort to resolve discovery disputes among themselves before involving the court.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion to Compel:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">If disputes remain unresolved, the aggrieved party may file a motion to compel, seeking a court order that mandates compliance from the non-compliant party. If granted, the non-compliant party may also be ordered to cover the costs, including attorney&apos;s fees, incurred by the filing party.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Contempt and Sanctions:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">If the non-compliant party disobeys a court&apos;s order to compel, they may face further sanctions, such as fines or contempt of court, with the exception of contempt for violating an order for a medical examination.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A defendant provides the plaintiff with some requested documents in a negligence lawsuit but refuses to submit other documents, claiming they are irrelevant. The plaintiff believes these documents are crucial to the case and insists on their production. Following the meet and confer obligation, both parties discuss the issue extensively, but the defendant maintains the objection. The plaintiff then files a motion to compel, asking the court to order the defendant to produce the contested documents. The court agrees with the plaintiff and grants the motion, ordering the defendant to provide the documents and to pay for the plaintiff&apos;s attorney&apos;s fees incurred due to the motion. After the court&apos;s order, if the defendant still withholds the documents without any lawful basis, the plaintiff can request the court to impose sanctions. The court may then decide to fine the defendant or hold them in contempt of court. However, if the dispute involved a court order for a medical examination that the defendant refused to obey, the remedy of contempt would not be available.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Handling Total Violations</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Total non-compliance, including a complete failure to respond to discovery requests or attend depositions, allows for immediate recourse. The aggrieved party can file a motion for sanctions without first filing a motion to compel, streamlining the process to address and rectify the violation swiftly.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a commercial litigation case, Defendant completely ignores Plaintiff&rsquo;s discovery requests, failing to provide any of the requested documents or respond to interrogatories. Additionally, Defendant repeatedly fails to appear for scheduled depositions, despite being properly noticed. Plaintiff, facing total non-compliance, bypasses the need to file a motion to compel and directly files a motion for sanctions against Defendant. The court, recognizing the clear disregard for the discovery process, grants Plaintiff&rsquo;s motion, applying appropriate sanctions which could range from fines to default judgment in favor of Plaintiff.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Sanctions Available</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A range of sanctions is available for discovery violations:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Monetary Sanctions:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Courts may order a non-compliant party to pay fines or reimburse the costs incurred by the compliant party due to the violation.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Issue Establishment:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Courts can order that certain facts be taken as established for the purposes of the current litigation.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Issue Preclusion:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The court may bar the non-compliant party from contesting certain issues that they failed to address during discovery.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Striking Pleadings:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A court has the authority to strike pleadings or parts of pleadings of a non-compliant party.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Dismissal or Default:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In cases of bad faith, a court can dismiss the non-compliant party&apos;s claims or issue a default judgment against them.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Expenses and Attorneys&apos; Fees:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;font-size:12pt;">
                <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The non-compliant party may be ordered to pay the expenses and attorneys&apos; fees incurred by the other party in seeking sanctions.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Certification Requirement</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A party moving for sanctions must certify to the court that they have attempted in good faith to obtain the information without court intervention before seeking judicial enforcement measures. This certification is essential to demonstrate that the request for sanctions is not frivolous and that all reasonable avenues for resolution were pursued.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">During a lawsuit between a plaintiff and a defendant over a breach of contract, the defendant is served with discovery requests including interrogatories and requests for production of documents. The deadline passes without any response from the defendant, nor do they attend the scheduled deposition. Upon this complete failure to comply with the discovery process, the plaintiff proceeds to file a motion for sanctions directly, bypassing the need to file a motion to compel given the defendant&apos;s total non-compliance. The court, recognizing the violation, may impose sanctions which could include fines, ruling in favor of the plaintiff on certain issues, or even entering a default judgment in favor of the plaintiff.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Step 8: Pretrial Disclosures</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Pursuant to FRCP 26, parties to a case are required to disclose additional information to each other and the court as the case nears trial, no later than 30 days before trial. This can include a list of witnesses they plan to call at trial, exhibits they plan to introduce, and any other information that may be relevant to the case. These disclosures are intended to promote fairness and efficiency in the trial process by allowing the parties to prepare for trial and to avoid surprises.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a contract dispute scheduled for trial, the plaintiff plans to call an accountant as a witness to detail the financial losses incurred due to the defendant&apos;s alleged breach. The plaintiff also intends to introduce the original signed contract, emails between parties discussing the contract, and financial statements as exhibits. Under FRCP 26, the plaintiff provides the defendant with the names and a brief description of the witnesses&apos; testimonies, including the accountant&apos;s qualifications and the nature of the expert testimony. The list of exhibits, with copies or descriptions of the emails and financial statements, is also shared. Simultaneously, the defendant, accusing the plaintiff of fraud, plans to introduce at trial a forensic expert&apos;s report that challenges the authenticity of the contract and call witnesses who allege misrepresentation by the plaintiff. The defendant discloses to the plaintiff the identity and expected testimony of the forensic expert and the fact witnesses, along with the anticipated exhibits, which include a forensic analysis of the contract&apos;s signature. This process ensures both parties are fully aware of each other&apos;s evidence and can adequately prepare for trial, fostering transparency and minimizing the chance of trial by ambush.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>





<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Voluntary Dismissal</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under FRCP 41(a), a plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss their action without a court order by filing a notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves an answer or a motion for summary judgment, or by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties. A party can voluntarily dismiss once without prejudice, but a second voluntary dismissal of the same claim operates as an adjudication on the merits, in other words a dismissal with prejudice.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff files a lawsuit against a real estate company claiming breach of contract. Before the defendant has served an answer or a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff decides to dismiss the case voluntarily. The plaintiff files a notice of dismissal under FRCP 41(a), which effectively ends the lawsuit without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff the opportunity to refile the case in the future if desired. Later, the plaintiff chooses to refile the lawsuit on the same breach of contract claim against the real estate company. This time, during the proceedings but again before the defendant serves an answer or a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff realizes that the case is not viable due to new evidence. The plaintiff decides to dismiss the case for a second time voluntarily. The plaintiff files a notice of dismissal, but because it is the second voluntary dismissal of the same claim, this dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits&mdash;meaning the case is dismissed with prejudice and cannot be refiled.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Involuntary Dismissal</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 41(b) allows a defendant to move for involuntary dismissal of an action or any claim against them for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with the FRCP or a court order. Unless the court specifies otherwise, involuntary dismissal, except for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication on the merits.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A defendant requests the court to involuntarily dismiss a lawsuit after discovering that the plaintiff has not pursued any discovery or motion practice for an extended period, demonstrating a clear failure to prosecute the case. The court finds this inaction sufficient to grant an involuntary dismissal under Rule 41(b), thereby treating the dismissal as an adjudication on the merits, which means the plaintiff cannot file the suit again on the same claim. In another instance, the plaintiff repeatedly disregards court orders and fails to adhere to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by missing filing deadlines. The defendant files a motion under Rule 41(b) for an involuntary dismissal based on these violations. The court grants the dismissal, which also operates as an adjudication on the merits. However, if the plaintiff&apos;s inaction was due to a misunderstanding about a scheduling order which the court deems not significant enough to warrant dismissal, or if the delays were largely due to the court&rsquo;s own busy schedule, the court might decide not to grant an involuntary dismissal since the requisite failure to prosecute or non-compliance with a court order is not met to the necessary degree. Additionally, if the plaintiff has been active in the litigation, responding to discovery, filing motions, and attending scheduled conferences, but has failed in some procedural aspect that can be remedied, such as failing to include a required verification on a document, the court is unlikely to find this as grounds for an involuntary dismissal under Rule 41(b). Instead, the plaintiff may be given an opportunity to correct the error without prejudice to their case.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Default Judgment</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 55 of the FRCP provides a clear procedure to get a default judgment, which a plaintiff can use if the defendant does not respond to a legal complaint. Initially, the court&apos;s clerk notes the defendant&apos;s failure to respond by recording a &apos;default&apos;. After this, if the amount the plaintiff is asking for is clear and specific, the clerk can issue a default judgment for that amount. If the claim involves a less clear or variable amount or is not about money at all, the plaintiff must ask the court to decide the judgment, possibly after reviewing more evidence or holding a hearing. Once a default judgment is issued, it is just as binding as any other judgment. However, a defendant has the right to try to overturn this judgment by showing they had a valid reason for not responding in the first place.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff sues a defendant for failing to pay a specific sum of money outlined in a contractual agreement. The defendant does not respond to the summons and complaint within the prescribed time limit. The plaintiff requests the court clerk to enter a &apos;default&apos; against the defendant, which is done. Because the money owed is a determinable amount, the clerk then enters a default judgment for the plaintiff in the amount specified in the lawsuit. In a different scenario within the same case, the plaintiff also includes a claim for an unspecified amount of damages due to emotional distress caused by the breach of contract. Since the amount of damages for emotional distress is not definite and involves subjective valuation, the plaintiff cannot obtain a default judgment from the clerk directly for this part of the claim. Instead, the plaintiff must request the court to conduct a hearing or review evidence to determine the appropriate amount for the judgment. After the default judgment is entered for the contractual amount, and potentially for the emotional distress claim following court adjudication, the defendant may move to have the judgment set aside. The defendant would need to present evidence of a valid excuse for the failure to respond, such as not receiving the summons and complaint due to an error in service, and demonstrate they have a meritorious defense to the lawsuit. If successful, the court may set aside the default judgment, allowing the case to proceed as if the defendant had timely responded.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Summary Judgment</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under Rule 56, any party may move for summary judgment on all or part of the claim or defense. The moving party must prove that (1) there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and (2) they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court views all evidence and any inferences that may be drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. If the moving party meets the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff sues Defendant for breach of contract, claiming Defendant failed to deliver goods under a sales agreement. Defendant files a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the agreement was void due to a lack of consideration, an essential component of a valid contract, and provides evidence that no consideration was exchanged. Plaintiff offers no evidence to refute this claim. The court grants summary judgment, as there is no genuine dispute on the material fact of consideration, and thus Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In a separate case, Plaintiff sues a real estate agent for professional negligence, claiming the agent failed to disclose known defects in a property. The real estate agent moves for summary judgment, providing inspection reports that show no defects were known at the time of sale. In response, Plaintiff presents emails from the real estate agent to her assistant mentioning concerns about the property&apos;s condition. The court denies summary judgment because Plaintiff&apos;s evidence creates a genuine dispute of material fact regarding the agent&rsquo;s knowledge of the defects, and the case must proceed to trial.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Declaratory Judgments</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The Declaratory Judgment Act under 28 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 2201-2202 empowers federal courts to explicitly determine the rights, duties, and obligations of parties involved in a dispute through a declaratory judgment, as long as there is a genuine case or controversy that falls under the courts&apos; purview. This act serves as a mechanism for individuals or entities to have their legal standing clarified preemptively, without the necessity of the counterparty initiating legal action. A declaratory judgment is essentially a court&apos;s statement on the legal status and rights of parties in a civil dispute.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a dispute over a land boundary, the plaintiff, a homeowner, seeks a declaratory judgment against the defendant, his neighbor, to determine the ownership of a contested piece of property. Both parties claim the property line falls favorably to their side according to old deeds and seek a legal determination before any potential trespass or property damage occurs. The federal court, acting under the Declaratory Judgment Act, issues a judgment stating the exact boundary line, clarifying both parties&apos; rights regarding the property in question. Simultaneously, a patent holder, the plaintiff, files for a declaratory judgment against a manufacturer, the defendant, to affirm the validity and enforceability of a patent before the defendant proceeds with production of a similar product, potentially leading to a patent infringement suit. The court&apos;s declaratory judgment upholds the patent&apos;s validity, thus outlining the plaintiff&apos;s legal standing and possible future actions in case of infringement by the defendant. Both scenarios demonstrate the use of the Declaratory Judgment Act to resolve issues of legal uncertainty and clarify the rights and obligations of all parties involved preemptively, avoiding more contentious litigation.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Dismissal for Lack of Prosecution</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Courts have the inherent power to dismiss an action for lack of prosecution to manage their dockets and avoid unnecessary delays in the disposition of pending cases. The power must be exercised by the judge with care, and usually comes after providing notice and an opportunity to be heard to the plaintiff.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff files a lawsuit against Defendant for breach of contract. After the initial pleadings, Plaintiff becomes non-responsive. The court schedules a pre-trial conference, but Plaintiff fails to appear and does not respond to court communications. The court then issues a notice to Plaintiff, warning that the case will be dismissed for lack of prosecution if no action is taken. Plaintiff once again does not respond. Accordingly, the judge, having provided notice and opportunity to be heard, dismisses the case for lack of prosecution to prevent unnecessary delays in the court&rsquo;s docket. Conversely, Plaintiff files a lawsuit against a real estate agent for fraud. As the case progresses, Plaintiff falls ill and informs the court, requesting a brief stay in proceedings. The court acknowledges the illness, temporarily stays the case, and does not dismiss it because the lack of prosecution is justified under the circumstances, and Plaintiff had communicated effectively with the court.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Dismissal for Failure to State a Claim</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under Rule 12(b)(6), a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. If granted, the dismissal is typically without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff may refile if the complaint can be corrected to overcome the deficiency identified by the court.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiff&apos;s complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. The court agrees that Plaintiff&apos;s complaint lacks sufficient factual allegations to support a legal claim and grants the motion, dismissing the case without prejudice. Plaintiff amends the complaint, adding necessary details and context to the previously vague allegations, and refiles. This new complaint now provides a clear basis for the claim, thus overcoming the prior deficiency.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Consent Decree</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A consent decree is an agreement between the parties that resolves the litigation and is entered as a final judgment by the court. It is not strictly a judgment, but rather a settlement agreement approved by the court. The agreement is submitted to the court in writing after the parties have reached a settlement, and once approved by the judge, the agreement is binding and enforceable on both parties.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a lawsuit where a plaintiff accuses a corporation of environmental violations, both parties agree to settle the case out of court. They draft a consent decree that requires the corporation to adhere to stricter environmental standards, pay for environmental restoration, and submit to third-party audits. The court reviews the terms, ensures they are fair and lawful, and then enters the consent decree as a final judgment. Months later, the plaintiff observes the corporation failing to comply with the environmental standards set out in the consent decree. The plaintiff returns to court, seeking enforcement of the decree. The court can exercise its contempt powers to enforce compliance, potentially imposing penalties on the corporation for non-compliance, thus illustrating the binding and enforceable nature of a consent decree as a judicial act, despite originating from mutual agreement.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Judgment on the Pleadings</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) is a request to enter a judgment based on the content of the pleadings without going to trial. It can be granted if, taking all allegations of the non-moving party as true, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. It must be done after both the complaint and the answer have been submitted.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Defendant files a motion for judgment on the pleadings in a breach of contract case, arguing that even if all of the allegations in the plaintiff&apos;s complaint are true, the contract at issue was voidable because the defendant was a minor at the time of signing. Since being a minor generally disqualifies a person from entering into a binding contract, the defendant would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the pleadings show that no other factual issues are in dispute that need resolution at trial. In another case, plaintiff files a motion for judgment on the pleadings in a defamation lawsuit against a newspaper. The plaintiff claims that the published article contained false statements. However, the newspaper&apos;s answer admits to the publication of the article but contends that the statements are true, which if proved, would be a defense to defamation. Since there are disputed facts about the truth of the statements, judgment on the pleadings would not be appropriate here.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>





<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Step 1: Mandatory Meet and Confer</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under the rules, attorneys are required to meet at least 21 days before the scheduling conference to discuss the claims, defenses, and the possibility of settlement. They must then collaboratively develop a discovery plan that addresses the needs and framework of information exchange during the discovery phase. This plan should be presented in writing to the court no later than 14 days after the meet and confer, ensuring that the court is apprised of the progress and direction of pretrial activities, facilitating an efficient litigation process.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a complex commercial litigation, attorneys for both the plaintiff and the defendant arrange a meeting 21 days before the scheduled pretrial conference. During this meeting, they discuss the specifics of the plaintiff&apos;s claims of breach of contract and the defendant&apos;s defenses, including assertions of performance of contractual obligations and the applicability of force majeure. They consider the potential for a settlement and realize while a full settlement may not be immediately achievable, they agree to mediation to potentially resolve some issues. Following negotiations on the scope and timing of discovery, they develop a discovery plan outlining the types of documents to be exchanged (such as contracts, emails, and financial records), the timing and format of depositions, and the use of electronic discovery to handle large volumes of data. They also agree on the necessity of preserving all relevant documents and establish a timeline for exchanging initial disclosures and completing discovery. The attorneys finalize their discovery plan within a few days to accommodate any last-minute adjustments. They submit the written discovery plan to the court 14 days after their meet and confer session, well ahead of the pretrial conference, enabling the court to review the proposed plan, provide any necessary guidance, and ensure that the upcoming litigation is managed efficiently.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Step 2: Scheduling Order</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The court must issue a scheduling order that limits the time to join other parties, amend pleadings, complete discovery, and file motions. This scheduling order, which essentially functions as a timeline for the case, can be issued as soon as practicable but must be within 120 days after any defendant has been served with the complaint or 90 days after any defendant has appeared. FRCP 16(b) governs the scheduling and planning of pretrial conferences, with the first conference to be held as soon as practicable after the attorneys for the parties have had a reasonable opportunity to confer. The scheduling order may be modified only for good cause and with the judge&rsquo;s consent. To establish good cause, the moving party must show that the schedule cannot reasonably be met despite their diligence.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff files a lawsuit against Defendant for personal injury. Defendant is served with the complaint, and within 120 days of this service, the court releases a scheduling order setting deadlines for joining additional parties, amending pleadings, completing discovery, and filing motions. The order sets these events to take place over the next six months, allowing both parties time to prepare their cases while advancing toward trial. Before the pretrial conference, attorneys for both parties meet to discuss settlement possibilities, exchange initial disclosures, and plan out discovery. They cannot reach an agreement on settlement, so they proceed to the pretrial conference. Here, guided by FRCP 16(b), the judge finalizes the deadlines in the scheduling order, encourages alternative dispute resolution methods, and sets dates for subsequent conferences to ensure the case proceeds efficiently.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Pretrial Conferences</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">During a pretrial conference, the court and the parties may consider the nature and basis of their claims and defenses, the possibilities for promptly settling or resolving the case, the control and scheduling of discovery, any issues relating to disclosure or preservation of electronically stored information and agreements to assert claims of privilege after production, the identification of witnesses and documents, the need for adopting special procedures for managing potentially difficult or protracted litigation, and the establishment of a trial date or a deadline for joining other parties or amending the pleadings. A final pretrial conference is typically held close to the trial date. It helps the court and parties finalize the preparation for trial, including considerations such as the examination of evidence and witnesses, trial procedures, and jury instructions. Pretrial conferences are also often used to facilitate settlement negotiations. The judge may refer the case to a magistrate judge or a court-appointed mediator to pursue settlement talks, or the judge may lead the settlement discussions themselves.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In preparation for a complex commercial litigation, a pretrial conference is held in which the plaintiff, a technology company, and the defendant, a supplier, along with their attorneys, meet with the judge to discuss the case. The judge outlines the basis of the claims, with the plaintiff alleging breach of contract and the defendant asserting a defense of force majeure due to unforeseen events. They explore possibilities of settlement, but as neither party is currently willing to compromise, they proceed to discuss discovery schedules. The judge emphasizes the need to disclose and preserve electronically stored information, including email correspondence and contractual documents, and sets strict deadlines for these tasks. Additionally, they agree to a procedure for handling privileged communication, deciding that a privilege log will be created for items withheld on the grounds of privilege. Both parties disclose their witness lists, which include industry experts, and the range of documents they plan to introduce as evidence. Given the potential for a lengthy trial, the judge discusses special procedures, including the bifurcation of issues to streamline the process. A trial date is set, and a final pretrial conference is scheduled. At the final pretrial conference, the parties review the admissibility of evidence, narrowing down the exhibits to those most pertinent to the case. They also agree on the logistics of witness testimony, including the use of video conferencing for certain out-of-state experts, and they finalize the jury instructions with the judge. To encourage settlement, the judge refers the case to a magistrate judge with experience in mediation. Both parties agree to one more attempt at mediation, recognizing the benefits of potentially resolving the dispute without incurring the costs and risks associated with trial.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Sanctions for Non-Compliance</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Failure to comply with the scheduling or pretrial order, appear at a pretrial conference, cooperate in the scheduling or conduct of a pretrial conference, or obey a pretrial order may result in sanctions. Sanctions may include the imposition of trial limits, striking pleadings, dismissing the action, or entering a default judgment.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff sues Defendant for personal injury. The court issues a pretrial scheduling order requiring the parties to exchange witness lists by a specific date. Defendant complies, but Plaintiff ignores the deadline and fails to submit the list. Defendant requests a pretrial conference. At the conference, Plaintiff appears but is unprepared and refuses to cooperate in rescheduling the witness exchange. The court, finding Plaintiff&apos;s noncompliance deliberate, orders sanctions by striking Plaintiff&rsquo;s pleadings and ultimately dismisses the action for failure to comply with the scheduling order and lack of cooperation during the pretrial conference. In a parallel scenario, Defendant is the party failing to comply with the pretrial order by not providing discovery materials. Defendant then fails to appear at the pretrial conference to discuss the matter. Given these omissions, the court decides to impose sanctions and enters a default judgment in favor of Plaintiff, due to Defendant&apos;s failure to participate in the pretrial process and to obey court orders.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>





<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Right to a Jury Trial</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The Seventh Amendment preserves the right to a jury trial in many civil cases, and FRCP 38 acknowledges that right. A party may demand a trial by jury for any issue with an amount in controversy exceeding $20 by submitting a written demand within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served. However, this right is preserved for suits for legal remedies and does not extend to suits for equitable remedies.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Hybrid Claim</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In cases involving hybrid claims, where both legal and equitable issues are present, the right to a jury trial is preserved for the legal aspects of the case. All facts central to the legal claim are triable by a jury. The equitable claim, however, will not be tried by a jury but will instead be decided by the judge. The legal claim is addressed first, followed by the equitable claim.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a lawsuit, the plaintiff brings a hybrid claim against the defendant consisting of an action for breach of contract seeking monetary damages (a legal issue) and a request for specific performance (an equitable remedy). Under the Seventh Amendment, the plaintiff has the right to a jury trial on the breach of contract claim, including determination of the existence of the contract and the extent of damages incurred. After the jury deliberates and provides a verdict on the legal issue, the judge will then decide the equitable claim for specific performance, determining whether it is an appropriate remedy given the facts of the case, including the jury&apos;s findings on the legal claims.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Number of Jurors</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Federal civil jury trials must have a jury consisting of a minimum of six members but no more than twelve. To reach a verdict, a unanimous decision is required from at least six jurors. Unlike some state courts, there are no alternate jurors in federal court. All jurors summoned participate in the trial unless excused by the court for a valid reason, known as good cause.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a federal civil jury trial involving a dispute between a plaintiff and a defendant over a breach of contract, the court empanels a jury of eight members after a voir dire process. During the trial, one juror falls ill and is excused by the court for good cause. The trial continues with the remaining seven jurors. At the conclusion of the trial, all seven jurors must unanimously agree on the verdict for the plaintiff or the defendant, as a split decision would result in a hung jury, necessitating a new trial.If a federal trial starts with a full panel of twelve jurors with no alternates, and one juror has to be excused due to a compelling reason, the trial can continue with the remaining eleven jurors all participating in the verdict, but, if multiple jurors are excused and the number falls below six, the trial cannot continue with the remaining jurors, as the federal requirement for a minimum of six active jurors is not fulfilled.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Jury Selection</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Jury selection, also known as voir dire, allows the parties to select an impartial panel. Prospective jurors are questioned by both the judge and the attorneys involved in the case. Challenges to jury selection can be for cause (each side has an unlimited amount), where there is some indication that a juror cannot be impartial, or peremptory (each side has three), which do not require a reason, although the use of peremptory challenges based on race or gender is prohibited.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">During jury selection for a civil case involving a contract dispute, the plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney observes a prospective juror, who is an accountant, exhibit discomfort when discussing complex financial transactions. Suspecting an inability to remain impartial due to the juror&apos;s own professional frustrations with such transactions, the plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney challenges this juror for cause. Meanwhile, the defendant&rsquo;s attorney sees another prospective juror, a retired teacher, nodding along with the plaintiff&rsquo;s arguments during voir dire, indicating a possible bias. The defendant&rsquo;s attorney challenges this juror for cause as well. The judge agrees in both instances and dismisses the jurors. Next, each attorney uses peremptory challenges. The plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney uses one to dismiss a prospective juror who, despite no explicit bias, seems to have a connection with the defendant, a local business owner, possibly through community activities. The defendant&rsquo;s attorney exercises a peremptory challenge against a juror who appears overly eager to serve, raising concerns about undisclosed motives. &nbsp;The plaintiff&apos;s attorney considers using a peremptory challenge on a prospective juror simply because he is a young male, but decides against it as this could be seen as gender discrimination, which is not a lawful basis for a peremptory challenge. Similarly, the defendant&rsquo;s attorney refrains from using a peremptory challenge on a prospective juror who is a female, for the same reason.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Conduct of the Jury Trial</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The conduct of a jury trial is overseen by the presiding judge, who provides instructions to the jury on the law that applies to the case. Trials are conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence, and parties may present witness testimony, documentary evidence, and expert analyses.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a civil lawsuit involving a breach of contract, the defendant, a real estate company, argues that the plaintiff, a customer, failed to understand the terms of the agreement. During the trial, the judge oversees the proceedings, ensuring they comply with the rules of evidence. When the plaintiff presents an email as evidence, the defendant objects on the grounds of hearsay. The judge examines the document, applies the rules of evidence, and determines the email falls under the business records exception to hearsay, thus allowing it. The defendant then calls an expert witness to testify about real estate contract norms to argue that their contract was standard and clear. The plaintiff challenges the credibility of the expert, but the judge instructs the jury on how to evaluate expert testimony, highlighting that it is their role to assess the reliability and relevance of the expert&apos;s analysis. Finally, as the trial concludes, the judge instructs the jury on the applicable law, explaining the elements of a breach of contract and the standards for interpreting contract terms. The jury is reminded to consider the evidence presented in light of these instructions, and their verdict must be based solely on the evidence and the judge&apos;s guidance on the law.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Jury Deliberations</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">After the close of evidence and the final arguments from the parties, the judge instructs the jury on the legal principles that must guide their deliberations. The jury then retires to the jury room to consider the evidence and reach a verdict. Their deliberations are private and confidential. The jury must reach a unanimous verdict in federal trials, unless the parties agree to a non-unanimous verdict prior to deliberation. The verdict must be based solely on the evidence presented and the instructions of the court. Once reached, the verdict is read in open court.</span></p>
<p><br></p>





<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a formal request for a court to dismiss a case on the grounds that the court does not have the legal authority to hear and decide the case in question. Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived and may be raised at any point during the proceedings, even after a trial has concluded. This type of motion asserts that the court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the dispute, such as a federal court considering a matter that does not involve a federal question or exceed the threshold for diversity jurisdiction. If granted, the case must be dismissed, as subject matter jurisdiction is a fundamental aspect that pertains to a court&apos;s ability to hear a particular type of case.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff files a lawsuit against Defendant in federal court alleging breach of contract, seeking damages of $50,000. Defendant does not challenge the jurisdiction, and the case proceeds to trial where Plaintiff is awarded damages. However, after the trial has concluded, Defendant discovers that Plaintiff and Defendant are residents of the same state, and thus there is no diversity of citizenship to confer federal jurisdiction, and the amount in controversy does not meet the federal threshold for diversity jurisdiction. Defendant then files a motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that the federal court never had the authority to hear the case as it did not present a federal question and did not meet diversity jurisdiction requirements. The court agrees, finding that subject matter jurisdiction is indeed lacking, and the earlier proceedings are nullified as the case is dismissed due to the absence of a fundamental aspect of the court&apos;s power to adjudicate the case.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">&lt;&lt;Motions that must be filed in the initial response (or they&rsquo;re waived)&gt;&gt;</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">These motions are discernible from the complaint itself; in other words, the defendant can tell whether they have grounds to move based on the complaint alone. While they are generally waived through failure to include them in the response, there are 2 exceptions:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">If the defendant who failed to include one in their response amends their responsive pleading as a matter of right to include the motion, then the motion stands provided the amendment was made within the time limit for amendments.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">If the motion wasn&rsquo;t available at the time the defendant made their initial response, and later becomes available, then the defendant still holds the right to file one of these motions.</span></p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">As outlined by FRCP 12(b)(2), a motion for lack of personal jurisdiction challenges the court&apos;s authority to hear a case against a particular defendant. This motion argues that the court does not have jurisdiction over the defendant because they do not have sufficient contacts with the forum state. The defendant must establish that they do not have minimum contacts with the state, and that exercising jurisdiction over them would violate their due process rights.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A defendant, a resident of State A, is sued by a plaintiff in State B for a breach of contract. The contract was negotiated and signed in State A, and the contractual obligations were to be performed in State A. The defendant files a motion under FRCP 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction, claiming they have no contacts with State B: they do not live there, have not conducted business there, and the contract itself has no connection to State B. The court agrees with the defendant&apos;s argument, acknowledging that exercising jurisdiction in State B would not be consistent with the principles of fair play and substantial justice, and dismisses the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion for Improper Venue</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A motion for improper venue as dictated by FRCP 12(b)(3) is filed when a party seeks to have the trial moved to a different geographical location, usually because the current venue is prejudiced, or for reasons of convenience and the interests of justice.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a high-profile criminal case, the defendant files a motion for improper venue, arguing that local media coverage has been extensively prejudicial, creating a community bias that denies a fair trial in the current location. The defendant supports the motion with evidence of pervasive and inflammatory media coverage, public demonstrations, and surveys demonstrating widespread preconceived notions of guilt among the prospective jurors in the area. Simultaneously, the defendant argues that a change of venue is also warranted for the convenience of witnesses and in the interest of justice. Several key witnesses who will provide alibi evidence are located in another jurisdiction, far from the current venue, imposing substantial travel burdens and potentially deterring their participation. Moreover, the defendant contends that a venue in closer proximity to these witnesses would serve the interests of justice by ensuring their important testimony can be heard.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion for Insufficient Process</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A motion for insufficient process under FRCP 12(b)(4) argues that there is a technical defect in the summons that was used to initiate the lawsuit. Examples of technical defects include errors in the name of the defendant or the court or failure to include required information in the summons. If the court grants the motion, the case may be dismissed without prejudice.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff files a lawsuit against a defendant for breach of contract and serves them with a summons. However, the summons names &quot;John Doe&quot; instead of the defendant&apos;s correct name &quot;John Roe,&quot; and incorrectly identifies the court as a state court when in fact the lawsuit is filed in federal court. The defendant files a motion under FRCP 12(b)(4) for insufficient process, pointing out the incorrect name and the misidentification of the court. The court agrees that these are technical defects in the summons because the wrong defendant name could cause confusion about who is being sued, and the incorrect court listing might mislead the defendant about where the case is pending. Consequently, the court grants the motion and dismisses the case without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff the opportunity to correct the errors and reissue the summons.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion for Insufficient Service of Process</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">As stated in FRCP 12(b)(5), a motion for insufficient service of process argues that the plaintiff did not properly serve the defendant with the summons and complaint, and therefore the court cannot exercise jurisdiction over them. The defendant may argue that they were not served in accordance with the applicable rules of civil procedure, or that the service was defective in some way. If granted, the court may order that the plaintiff serve the defendant again, or it may dismiss the case without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to refile with proper service.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff sues Defendant over a contract dispute and sends the summons and complaint via regular mail without any form of tracking or confirmation of receipt. Defendant, unaware of the lawsuit because they never received the summons, fails to appear in court. Upon learning of the default judgment against them, Defendant files a motion under FRCP 12(b)(5) for insufficient service of process, arguing that they were never properly served as required by law. The court agrees and finds the service to be defective. As a result, the court vacates the default judgment and orders Plaintiff to properly serve Defendant according to the rules, thereby allowing the case to proceed only after proper service is effected, ensuring that the court has jurisdiction over Defendant.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&lt;&lt;Motions that must be filed before trial&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">After the pleadings are closed, a party may move for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c). The court will grant the motion if it is based solely on the pleadings, there are no material facts in dispute, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff sues Defendant for breach of contract, seeking damages and alleging Defendant failed to deliver goods as agreed. Defendant files an answer denying the allegations and asserting affirmative defenses. Following this, Defendant files a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing the contract was void due to illegality. Plaintiff has no factual rebuttal, arguing only the legal implications of the alleged contract. Since the court finds the contract illegal based on the pleadings with no material facts in dispute, it grants Defendant&apos;s motion, ruling as a matter of law that Plaintiff cannot recover on an illegal agreement.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion for More Definite Statement</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A motion for a more definite statement under Rule 12(e) is appropriate when a pleading is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably respond. The court may order the pleading party to clarify or make a more definite statement. A motion for more definite statement must be filed before responding to a pleading.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a breach of contract case, the defendant is served with a complaint that is unclear and lacks specific details regarding the alleged contractual terms that were breached. The defendant files a motion for a more definite statement under Rule 12(e), claiming the complaint is too vague and ambiguous to formulate a proper response. The court grants the motion, ordering the plaintiff to revise the complaint with specificity. Consequently, the plaintiff provides a detailed amendment clarifying the exact contractual obligations alleged to be breached and the actions constituting the breach. This allows the defendant to address each point in their responsive pleading.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion to Strike</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under Rule 12(f), a party may file a motion to strike to remove redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous content from an opponent&rsquo;s pleadings. This can be used to clean up the pleadings and focus on the relevant issues. A motion to strike is typically filed early in the case, within 21 days after being served with the pleading.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff files a lawsuit against a defendant for breach of contract. In the complaint, the plaintiff includes allegations about the defendant&apos;s personal life that have no bearing on the contract issue. The defendant responds with a Rule 12(f) motion to strike these allegations as scandalous and impertinent. Additionally, the plaintiff&rsquo;s complaint contains several paragraphs that repetitively state the same claim in different words, prompting the defendant to also move to strike those parts as redundant. The court grants the motion, removing the irrelevant personal allegations and redundant statements, thus streamlining the pleadings to focus solely on the breach of contract claim. The motion to strike was filed promptly, within the 21-day period after the defendant was served with the plaintiff&apos;s complaint.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">&lt;&lt;Motions that can be raised before and during trial&gt;&gt;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion for Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief can be Granted</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">This motion, commonly known as a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, is a procedural device used to challenge the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff&apos;s claims. The defendant argues that, even if all the facts alleged in the complaint are true, there is no legal basis for the lawsuit, and therefore, it should be dismissed. This motion tests the complaint&apos;s legal grounds without regard to the truth of the plaintiff&apos;s allegations</span></h4>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff sues Defendant for breach of contract, claiming Defendant failed to deliver goods under a sales agreement. Defendant files a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, contending that even accepting Plaintiff&apos;s facts as true, the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the contract was not in writing, and the alleged agreement pertains to the sale of land which, under the Statute of Frauds, requires a written contract to be enforceable. Here, the court would likely grant the motion to dismiss as the plaintiff&apos;s claim lacks a legal basis due to the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. In a different case, Plaintiff brings a lawsuit against Defendant alleging negligence after slipping and falling in Defendant&apos;s store. Defendant submits a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, asserting that Plaintiff&apos;s complaint does not establish a legal claim because it does not allege any specific act of negligence on the part of the Defendant, such as a failure to clean a spill or warn of a known danger. If the complaint merely states Plaintiff fell without attributing fault to Defendant through a specific negligent act, the court may grant the motion for failing to state a claim under which relief can be granted. Both examples demonstrate the application of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a case for lack of a legally sufficient claim, regardless of the claimed facts&apos; veracity.</span></h4>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion for Failure to Join a Party</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">A motion for failure to join a party is based on Rule 19 of the FRCP, asserting that a person not currently part of the lawsuit is a required party because of their interest in the subject matter of the action. The absence of this party may impede their ability to protect their interests or may expose the existing parties to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations.</span></h4>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a lawsuit where a plaintiff sues a construction company for breach of contract, the plaintiff might file a motion for failure to join a party, claiming that the architect who designed the project is a required party. This is because the architect&rsquo;s design choices could be central to the dispute, and without their involvement, the architect may be unable to protect their interests and may be subject to subsequent litigation. Conversely, the construction company may argue that if the architect is not joined, they could face double liabilities &ndash; one from the current lawsuit and another from a potential suit by the architect claiming damages for defamation or misrepresentation of their work.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion for Summary Judgment</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 56 allows a party to move for summary judgment, requesting the court to rule that the other party has no case because there are no disputed issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Summary judgment can be requested on the entire case or on specific issues. A motion for summary judgment can be filed at any time until 30 days after the close of discovery.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a property damage lawsuit, the plaintiff claims the defendant&apos;s negligence caused substantial damage to their home. The defendant files a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the undisputed surveillance footage and expert testimony conclusively show the defendant was not present at the location at the time of the incident, thus not responsible for the alleged damage. The defendant asserts that, as there is no genuine issue of material fact with regard to their presence and the causation of the damage, they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Since this motion is filed after the discovery period, which revealed no evidence to support the plaintiff&apos;s claim of the defendant&apos;s negligence, the court is asked to rule on this clear factual and legal basis without the necessity of a trial. Conversely, for the claim of damages, the plaintiff presents receipts, contractor estimates, and expert reports indicating the extent and cost of repairs, which the defendant disputes. As there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the valuation of damages, summary judgment would not be appropriate for this aspect of the case, and it should proceed to trial.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">&lt;&lt;Motions that must be raised during trial&gt;&gt;</span></h4>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (JMOL)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A motion for judgment as a matter of law &mdash; formerly known as a directed verdict &mdash; is a request made by a party during a trial, asking the court to enter a judgment in their favor because the opposing party has insufficient evidence to reasonably support its case. Under FRCP 50, a JMOL can be requested by a party before the case is submitted to the jury if the facts and the law lead to only one reasonable conclusion. If granted, the motion ends the trial and precludes the need for jury deliberation, as the judge determines the evidence presented is so legally deficient that no reasonable jury could find for the opposing party. JMOL ensures the court&apos;s gatekeeping role in preventing legally baseless claims or defenses from being considered by a jury.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff sues Defendant for patent infringement, asserting that Defendant&apos;s new product violates Plaintiff&apos;s patent rights. During the trial, Plaintiff presents all of its evidence including expert testimony on the patent&apos;s validity and alleged infringement. Defendant moves for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) at the close of Plaintiff&apos;s case, arguing that Plaintiff has failed to establish a key element of patent infringement&mdash;that Defendant&apos;s product operates under the same principles as the patented invention. Defendant demonstrates that, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, no reasonable jury could find for Plaintiff based on the evidence presented, as there is a clear discrepancy in the mechanism of action between the products. The judge grants the motion for JMOL as it is clear that the Plaintiff has not met the burden of proof regarding infringement and the facts, and the law leads to only one reasonable conclusion in Defendant&apos;s favor. As a result, the trial ends immediately without the need for jury deliberation, reaffirming the court&apos;s responsibility to ensure that claims with insufficient legal basis are not left to the decision of a jury.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">&lt;&lt;Posttrial motions&gt;&gt;</span></h4>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (RJMOL)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Also known as a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, RJMOL is a way for parties to challenge the jury&apos;s verdict on the grounds that the evidence presented at trial does not factually support that verdict, but it can only be filed if the moving party has previously filed a motion for JMOL. Under FRCP 50, a renewed motion for JMOL must be filed within 28 days after the entry of judgment.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff sues a defendant for breach of contract, and the case goes to trial. The jury returns a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant believes the evidence presented during the trial was insufficient to support the jury&apos;s verdict. Therefore, within 28 days after the entry of the judgment, the defendant files a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) under FRCP 50, arguing that the evidence does not support the verdict and that the court should enter judgment in favor of the defendant despite the jury&apos;s decision. If the court agrees that the evidence does not legally suffice to justify the verdict, it may overturn the jury&apos;s decision and enter judgment for the defendant. If, however, the evidence is deemed legally sufficient, the court will deny the motion, and the jury&apos;s verdict will stand.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Motion for a New Trial</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Pursuant to FRCP 59(a), this motion is filed if the party believes the trial was not fair, new evidence has been discovered, or there was an error in law, and should be filed within 28 days of the judgment.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff loses a civil case and files a motion under FRCP 59(a) within the 28-day period, insisting that the trial was unfair due to juror misconduct not discovered until after the verdict. This motion is valid as it points to a potential compromise of a fair trial. In a separate case, a defendant finds new evidence two weeks post-judgment that would likely change the outcome of the trial, which could not have been found with reasonable diligence before the trial&apos;s end. The defendant files a motion under FRCP 59(a) within the required time frame, asserting the right for a reconsideration of the judgment. Meanwhile, another plaintiff requests a FRCP 59(a) motion on the 30th day following judgment, alleging an error in law, but this motion is procedurally barred for being filed outside of the 28-day limit.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Additur and Remittitur</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Additur and remittitur are judicial practices used to correct a jury&apos;s damages award deemed unreasonable by the trial court. Additur refers to the process whereby a judge increases a jury&apos;s award of damages if it is deemed unreasonably low, essentially giving the defendant the option to accept the higher amount or face a new trial. However, additur is not permitted in federal courts due to concerns about infringing on the 7th Amendment right to a jury trial (it is permitted in state courts, however, since the 7th Amendment has not been incorporated into states). On the other hand, remittitur is used when a jury&apos;s damages award is excessively high and appears to be influenced by passion, prejudice, or another improper factor. The judge may offer the plaintiff the option of accepting a lower, court-determined award or undergoing a new trial. Remittitur is generally accepted in both federal and state courts as a means to avoid the expense and time of retrial while rectifying what the court perceives as a jury&apos;s error in awarding damages.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">During a personal injury trial, a jury awards Plaintiff $100,000 for pain and suffering. However, the evidence presented during the trial does not support such a high award; the injury was minor and Plaintiff had a quick recovery. The Defendant requests a remittitur, arguing the award is excessive and influenced by the jury&apos;s sympathy for Plaintiff rather than facts. The judge agrees and offers Plaintiff the choice of accepting $50,000 or facing a new trial. In a separate case in state court, a jury awards Plaintiff $10,000 in a case of severe and permanent injuries, where the evidence suggested damages should be substantially higher. Recognizing the award as unreasonably low, the judge exercises additur, proposing to increase the award to $200,000 and giving Defendant the option of either accepting the higher amount or submitting to a new trial. Defendant accepts the increased amount to avoid the cost and uncertainty of another trial.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>





<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 55(a) Defaults</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under Rule 55(a) of the FRCP, a default occurs when a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought fails to plead or otherwise defend as required by law. The court clerk must enter the party&apos;s default upon request of the opposing party, thus formally noting the default in the court record. This entry of default signifies that the defendant has not responded in time to the plaintiff&rsquo;s complaint, which opens the path for the plaintiff to seek a default judgment, as detailed in Rule 55(b).</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff files a lawsuit against Defendant for breach of contract. Defendant fails to respond to the complaint within the time frame set by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiff requests the court clerk to enter Defendant&rsquo;s default, which the clerk does, acknowledging officially that Defendant failed to defend as required. Plaintiff then proceeds under Rule 55(b) to seek a default judgment because of Defendant&rsquo;s lack of response, allowing Plaintiff to potentially win the case without further contest from the Defendant.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 55(b) Default Judgments</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Once default is entered under Rule 55(a), Rule 55(b) allows a plaintiff to request a default judgment, which can either be entered by the clerk if the claim is for a sum certain or a sum that can be made certain by computation, or by the courtin all other cases. When the court enters a default judgment, it may conduct hearings or take evidence if necessary to determine the amount of damages, establish the truth of any allegation by evidence, or investigate any other matter.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff files a breach of contract lawsuit against Defendant for not paying for delivered goods, the contract stipulates the exact amount due. Defendant fails to respond to the lawsuit, and Plaintiff requests the entry of default under Rule 55(a). The clerk enters the default as the damages are a sum certain. Subsequently, Plaintiff seeks a default judgment and the clerk, under Rule 55(b), enters judgment for Plaintiff in the amount specified in the contract. Alternatively, Plaintiff sues Defendant for damages after a car accident. Defendant ignores the lawsuit and default is entered. Here, the amount of damages is not certain and requires assessment. Plaintiff moves for a default judgment under Rule 55(b) and the court schedules a hearing to determine the damages, allowing Plaintiff to present evidence of medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering to establish the total amount owed, leading to the court&apos;s judgment for Plaintiff.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Setting Aside Default Judgments</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 55(c) provides that the court may set aside an entry of default for good cause, and it may set aside a default judgment as per the same standards applicable under Rule 60(b). Grounds for setting aside a default judgment include mistakes, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, or any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff files a lawsuit against a defendant for breach of contract. The defendant, failing to respond to the lawsuit within the prescribed time, has a default entered against him. Realizing the mistake, the defendant petitions the court to set aside the default entry, citing his recent hospitalization and resulting incapacitation as excusable neglect for missing the deadline&mdash;this demonstrates &quot;good cause&quot; per Rule 55(c). Meanwhile, in a separate case, a default judgment is entered against a defendant when she did not appear in court. Later, she discovers her attorney had failed to inform her of the court date due to a clerical error, representing a mistake. She seeks to have the default judgment set aside under Rule 60(b), arguing that her reliance on her attorney&rsquo;s competence was reasonable and the error was not due to her own negligence. In both instances, the courts may set aside the entry of default and default judgment based on the established grounds of excusable neglect and mistake, respectively, demonstrating the application of Rule 55(c) and Rule 60(b) standards.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Involuntary Dismissal</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Under Rule 41(b), a defendant may move for the involuntary dismissal of an action due to the plaintiff&rsquo;s failure to prosecute the case, comply with the FRCP, or adhere to a court order. An involuntary dismissal acts as an adjudication on the merits, which means it serves as a final decision in the defendant&apos;s favor, barring the plaintiff from bringing an action on the same claim in the future. Exceptions to this include dismissals for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party under Rule 19.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff files a suit against Defendant for breach of contract. Over time, Plaintiff neglects the case, neither pursuing discovery nor responding to Defendant&apos;s interrogatories. Defendant moves for involuntary dismissal under Rule 41(b) due to Plaintiff&rsquo;s failure to prosecute. The court grants the motion, which acts as an adjudication on the merits, preventing Plaintiff from suing Defendant on the same contract claim again. In a different case, Plaintiff sues Defendant, but the court lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendant. Defendant moves for dismissal on these grounds, and the court dismisses the case. This dismissal, however, is not an adjudication on the merits because it is for lack of jurisdiction, so Plaintiff may refile the claim in a court with proper jurisdiction.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Voluntary Dismissal</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 41(a) allows a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss their action without a court order by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before the opposing party serves either an answer or a motion for summary judgment. If a plaintiff has previously dismissed any federal or state court action based on or including the same claim, a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits. A plaintiff may also dismiss a case by stipulation of the parties. This can be done an infinite amount of times, but the defendant may refuse to stipulate or stipulate and include a term in the stipulation that renders the dismissal as being with prejudice.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff files a lawsuit against Defendant over a breach of contract. Before Defendant serves an answer or a motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff decides to withdraw the case to seek a more favorable forum and files a notice of dismissal under Rule 41(a). This is Plaintiff&rsquo;s first time dismissing an action regarding this contract dispute, so the dismissal is without prejudice, which implies that Plaintiff could refile the lawsuit in the future. However, Plaintiff indeed refiles the case in a different federal district court. Defendant, aware of Plaintiff&rsquo;s previous voluntary dismissal, expeditiously serves a motion for summary judgment this time. Plaintiff, realizing that the motion for summary judgment may have merit and could lead to a dismissal on the merits, attempts to file another notice of dismissal. Since an answer or a motion for summary judgment has been served, Rule 41(a) no longer allows Plaintiff to unilaterally dismiss the action without the court&rsquo;s approval. In a separate scenario, Plaintiff files the same breach of contract lawsuit against Defendant but this time, after some negotiations, both parties agree to settle their dispute out of court. They both sign a stipulation of dismissal agreeing that the case should be dismissed. In this situation, the stipulation means that neither party requires the court&apos;s permission to dismiss the case, and the dismissal can occur regardless of any previous dismissals because it is mutually agreed upon. If Defendant was wary of Plaintiff refiling, Defendant could have stipulated that the dismissal is with prejudice, which would prevent Plaintiff from bringing an action on the same claim again.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Dismissal for Lack of Prosecution</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Federal courts have the inherent authority to dismiss cases for lack of prosecution to manage their calendars and prevent undue delays in the resolution of pending cases. This type of dismissal acts as an adjudication on the merits unless the court specifies otherwise.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Dismissal for Failure to Comply with Court Orders</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Failure to comply with court orders can result in dismissal of the case. Similar to involuntary dismissal under Rule 41(b), this sanction is used to enforce compliance with court procedures and orders.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff files a lawsuit against a defendant for breach of contract. During the litigation process, the court orders both parties to engage in mediation to attempt a settlement. The defendant participates in the mediation as ordered, but the plaintiff refuses to attend without providing any justification. Due to the plaintiff&apos;s failure to comply with the court order, the court issues an involuntary dismissal of the case under Rule 41(b) as a sanction for noncompliance. In a separate case, a defendant is ordered by the court to produce certain documents that are crucial evidence in a negligence lawsuit. The defendant repeatedly ignores the court&apos;s deadlines and fails to provide the documents. As a result, the court dismisses the defendant&apos;s counterclaims for failure to comply with court orders, applying a similar sanction as would be used under Rule 41(b), enforcing obedience to its procedural mandates.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>





<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Findings of Fact</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In non-jury trials, the court must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law separately. Findings of fact are the court&apos;s determination of what happened based on the evidence presented at trial. These findings must be comprehensive enough to provide a clear understanding of the basis of the court&apos;s decision.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a contract dispute trial without a jury, a plaintiff claims that the defendant failed to deliver goods per their agreement, while the defendant argues that the contract was void due to a mutual mistake. The court conducts the trial and makes detailed findings of fact: it determines the existence of the contract, the specific terms of the agreement, the fulfillment of contract conditions by the plaintiff, the delivery failure by the defendant, and the lack of evidence for a mutual mistake. Based on these facts, the court states its conclusions of law separately, explaining the application of contract law to the facts, such as the enforcement of the valid contract and the lack of any defenses. The court then renders a decision in favor of the plaintiff for the non-delivery of goods, awarding damages calculated based on the contract terms. These comprehensive findings of fact and conclusions of law provide a clear basis for the court&rsquo;s decision, ensuring that the judgment is grounded in law and fact, and facilitating appellate review if necessary.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Conclusions of Law</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Conclusions of law, on the other hand, involve the court&apos;s application of legal principles to the facts it has determined. The judge must articulate the legal reasoning behind its decision, identifying the rules and legal standards that affect the outcome.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff sues a defendant for breach of contract. After a bench trial, the judge rules in favor of the plaintiff, issuing a detailed opinion. In the opinion, the judge first recites the factual findings, such as the existence of a valid contract and the defendant&apos;s failure to deliver goods as agreed. The judge then turns to conclusions of law, applying the relevant contract law principles to these facts. The judge explains that under contract law, a breach occurs when one party fails to perform as stipulated in the agreement and determines that the defendant&apos;s failure constitutes a breach. The opinion concludes with the judge&apos;s legal reasoning that, based on the established facts and the application of contract law, the plaintiff is entitled to damages. This written opinion allows any appellate court to review the judge&apos;s application of law to the facts, making clear the legal standards used and the rationale behind the decision.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Special Verdicts</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Special verdicts are detailed judicial instructions that require the jury to make findings on individual factual issues rather than to decide the ultimate question of liability. Under a special verdict, the jury answers a series of specific questions about the facts of the case, and the court then applies the law to these findings to determine the outcome. This type of verdict ensures that the jury&apos;s conclusions on each disputed factual issue are clear, which can be particularly useful in complex cases or when the court needs to understand the jury&apos;s reasoning for the final judgment or for appellate review.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a complex product liability case involving an allegedly defective ladder, Plaintiff claims that the design of the ladder was inherently unsafe and was the direct cause of their injuries. Defendant argues that the ladder met all safety standards and that Plaintiff&apos;s improper use of the ladder was the actual cause of the accident. The court uses a special verdict form, asking the jury to answer specific questions: (1) Did Defendant manufacture the ladder? (2) Was the ladder defective in its design? (3) Did Plaintiff use the ladder in a reasonably foreseeable manner? (4) Was the defective design a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff&apos;s injuries? (5) What is the total amount of Plaintiff&apos;s damages. The jury answers yes to questions 1, 2, and 4, no to question 3, and states a damages amount in question 5. Based on these answers, the court applies the law regarding product liability, deriving that Defendant is liable for the defective ladder design, which was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff&apos;s injuries, despite Plaintiff&apos;s misuse, and awards damages accordingly. The detailed responses on the special verdict form provide a clear basis for the court&apos;s application of the law, and if necessary, for an appellate court to review the jury&apos;s factual determinations.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">General Verdicts</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">General verdicts require the jury to reach a conclusion on the overall issue of liability and, if appropriate, the amount of damages. Unlike special verdicts, general verdicts do not provide detailed findings on each question of fact; rather, they reflect the jury&apos;s ultimate decision regarding which party should prevail in the case. General verdicts are more common in less complex cases where the resolution does not depend on specific factual determinations beyond the questions of liability and damages.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Defendant rear-ends Plaintiff&apos;s car, causing injury and vehicle damage. Plaintiff sues Defendant for negligence and presents evidence of both liability&mdash;such as traffic violation by Defendant&mdash;and damages, including medical bills and car repair costs. The jury finds Defendant liable and awards Plaintiff a sum to cover the damages without providing a breakdown of how they assessed fault or calculated specific damages. This general verdict simply indicates Defendant is at fault and must pay Plaintiff the awarded sum, aligning with the less complex nature of the case and direct questions of liability and damages.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Reopening, Supplementing, and Amending Facts</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 52 of the FRCP allows a party to request that a trial court reopen the evidence, supplement the findings, or amend the facts even after a judgment has been entered. This can occur in bench trials where the judge may revise findings of fact or conclusions of law. Reopening evidence may be requested when crucial evidence was not considered, and supplementing or amending findings may be necessary if the initial determination overlooked or misinterpreted the facts. A motion to alter or amend a judgment based on the trial court&apos;s findings must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of judgment.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Defendant is found liable in a bench trial for breach of contract and a judgment is entered against him. After the judgment, Defendant discovers a key piece of evidence that could exonerate him but was not presented due to an oversight by his legal team. He files a motion under Rule 52 to reopen the evidence, arguing it&apos;s crucial and could have significantly affected the trial&apos;s outcome. The judge agrees that the evidence is material and reopens the case to consider this new evidence, potentially altering the findings of fact. In a separate issue within the same case, the Plaintiff realizes that the judge&apos;s legal analysis misunderstood the terms of the contract when entering conclusions of law. The Plaintiff files a motion within 28 days after the judgment, requesting the court to supplement the findings and amend the conclusions of law to reflect the correct interpretation of the contract. The judge reviews the motion, acknowledges the misinterpretation, and amends the conclusions of law to properly reflect the contract&apos;s terms, which may alter the judgment in Plaintiff&apos;s favor.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>





<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Res Judicata (Claim Preclusion)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Res judicata, also known as claim preclusion, bars a party from suing on a claim that has already been litigated and decided. It applies to claims that were brought or could have been brought in the first action.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff sues Defendant in State Court A for negligence after a car accident, seeking damages for personal injury. The court renders a judgment in Defendant&apos;s favor. Later, Plaintiff attempts to sue Defendant again in State Court B, not for personal injury, but for the property damage to Plaintiff&apos;s car from the same accident. Since the property damage claim could have been brought in the first action in State Court A, Res Judicata applies, and the court bars the second lawsuit, precluding Plaintiff from relitigating the claim.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Elements of Res Judicata</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">For res judicata to apply, three elements must be present: (1) a final judgment on the merits in an earlier suit, (2) an identity of the causes of action in both the earlier and later suit, and (3) an identity of the parties or their privies in the two suits.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff sues Defendant for negligence in causing a car accident in Federal Court A and receives a final judgment on the merits in their favor. Later, Plaintiff decides to sue Defendant again for property damage resulting from the same car accident in Federal Court B. Defendant moves to dismiss the case based on res judicata, arguing that the three elements are met: the final judgment on the merits from Federal Court A, the cause of action for property damage is identical to the negligence claim as it arises from the same car accident, and the parties are the same in both suits. The court agrees and dismisses the case, with res judicata barring Plaintiff from litigating the property damage claim.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Final Judgment on the Merits</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The prior decision must be a final judgment on the merits, which means it represents a legal declaration of the parties&apos; rights and obligations. A judgment is considered on the merits when it is based on legal rights and liabilities, as opposed to matters of procedure, jurisdiction, or some other issue not related to the substance of the claim.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff sues a defendant for negligence after a car accident. The court presides over the case, evaluates all evidence presented, and decides in favor of the defendant, determining that the defendant was not negligent. This decision is a final judgment on the merits, as it involves a legal declaration of the parties&apos; rights and obligations regarding the substantive claim of negligence. Conversely, the same plaintiff initially filed the lawsuit in a court that lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant moves to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, and the court grants the motion. This dismissal is not a judgment on the merits, as it is based on a procedural issue rather than the legal rights and liabilities concerning the plaintiff&apos;s substantive claim of negligence.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Identity of the Cause of Action</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The cause of action in subsequent litigation is the same as in the earlier proceeding if it arises out of the same nucleus of operative facts as the prior claim.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff sues a defendant for breach of contract after the defendant fails to deliver goods per their agreement. The court dismisses the case on procedural grounds without addressing the breach itself. Later, the plaintiff brings a new lawsuit against the defendant, this time alleging tortious interference with a prospective economic advantage, claiming the defendant intentionally advised a third party not to enter into a business relationship with the plaintiff, which involved the same undelivered goods from the previous contract dispute. The defendant moves to dismiss, arguing res judicata applies because both lawsuits are rooted in the same nucleus of operative facts surrounding the non-delivery of goods. Despite the different legal theories, the cause of action is essentially the same because both claims are linked to the same central facts of the undelivered goods and the contractual relationship between the plaintiff and defendant.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Identity of Parties or Privies</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Parties or their privies must be the same in both suits. A privy is someone who is so identified with a party that their interests are represented in litigation, such as successors in interest.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In the first lawsuit, a plaintiff sues a property developer for breach of contract. The court rules in favor of the plaintiff. The property developer sells the disputed property to an investor before the judgment is finalized. The investor, aware of the ongoing litigation, later attempts to challenge the court&apos;s decision, claiming that the original contract was invalid. Here, the investor is prevented from relitigating the issue because as a successor in interest who purchased the property with knowledge of the lawsuit, they are considered a privy to the property developer. Their interests were already represented in the original litigation. In another case, a defendant is sued for personal injury by a plaintiff after a car accident. The defendant is covered by an insurance policy, and the insurance company handles the defense. A judgment is entered against the defendant. Later, the insurance company is sued by the defendant for not providing a proper defense, which is a separate claim of malpractice or breach of contract. The insurance company cannot claim they are a privy to the original suit because their potential negligence in defending the case is a separate issue from the defendant&apos;s liability for the car accident.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Collateral Estoppel (Issue Preclusion)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Collateral Estoppel, known as issue preclusion, precludes the relitigation of an issue that has already been decided in a former suit. This doctrine can be used in a subsequent action based on a different claim.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff sues a defendant in State Court A for negligence after a car accident and the court determines that the defendant was not speeding at the time of the accident. This finding is a crucial part of the court&apos;s final decision in favor of the defendant. Later, the plaintiff brings a new lawsuit against the same defendant in State Court B, this time claiming reckless driving in the same incident. Invoking collateral estoppel, the defendant argues that the issue of speeding, which is critical to the claim of recklessness, has already been decided by Court A, and therefore cannot be relitigated. The court in State Court B agrees and precludes the plaintiff from arguing that the defendant was speeding at the time of the accident, as this issue was conclusively determined in the previous lawsuit.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Elements of Collateral Estoppel</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">For collateral estoppel to apply, four elements are required: (1) the issue at stake must be identical to the one involved in the prior litigation, (2) the issue must have been actually litigated and decided in the prior suit, (3) there must have been a full and fair opportunity for litigation of the issue in the prior suit, and (4) the issue must have been necessary to support a valid and final judgment on the merits.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a previous lawsuit, a plaintiff sued a defendant for negligence after a car accident, and the court found the defendant was speeding and, therefore, negligent. This issue was essential to the final judgment, which favored the plaintiff. Later, the defendant&apos;s insurance company refuses to cover the damages, leading to a second lawsuit where the defendant claims they were not speeding. In this second case, collateral estoppel would prevent the defendant from re-litigating the speeding issue because it is identical to the one decided in the prior case, it was actually litigated and decided against the defendant, there was an opportunity for a full and fair litigation in the prior suit, and the issue of speeding was necessary to support the valid and final judgment on the merits in the initial lawsuit.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Actual Litigation and Decision</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The issue must have been explicitly raised and actually determined in the previous litigation. General references to an issue or subject are not sufficient.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff sues Defendant for breach of contract in Federal Court, claiming Defendant failed to deliver goods. During the litigation, Plaintiff explicitly raises an issue regarding the interpretation of a delivery clause within the contract. The court makes a definitive ruling on this clause, deciding in Defendant&apos;s favor that the clause does not require delivery by a specific date. Plaintiff later tries to sue Defendant in State Court, arguing that Defendant was in breach for not delivering the goods by that specific date. The State Court dismissed the case under the doctrine of issue preclusion since the issue of the delivery clause interpretation was explicitly raised and actually determined in the previous federal case.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Opportunity for Full and Fair Litigation</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the initial proceeding. This includes the chance to present evidence and arguments.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff sues Defendant in State Court for breach of contract, and the case goes to trial. The court specifically finds that Defendant did not sign the contract in dispute, which is essential to Plaintiff&apos;s claim. This finding is integral to the final judgment in favor of Defendant. Later, Plaintiff brings a new lawsuit against Defendant in Federal Court, seeking damages based on the same contract. Defendant argues collateral estoppel, asserting that the issue of whether Defendant signed the contract was already litigated in State Court. Since Defendant had a full and fair opportunity to contest the signing of the contract in the initial proceeding, presenting extensive evidence and legal arguments, and the court made a definitive ruling on that issue, collateral estoppel would preclude Plaintiff from re-litigating this issue in Federal Court.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Necessary to Judgment</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The determination of the issue must have been essential to the final judgment in the previous litigation, not merely incidental or collateral to it.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff brings a property dispute against a defendant, claiming ownership of a piece of land. The court hears the case and issues a final judgment, declaring that the plaintiff is the rightful owner based on a detailed evaluation of deed records and property laws. This determination of ownership is essential to the final judgment, directly addressing the heart of the dispute and deciding the case&apos;s primary issue. In contrast, during the same litigation, the court also rules that a witness for the defendant is not credible based on inconsistent testimony. While this assessment might influence the final judgment, the credibility of the witness is not itself an essential determination of property rights in the previous litigation but rather a collateral consideration in arriving at the final judgment regarding land ownership.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Non Mutual Defensive and Offensive Collateral Estoppel</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Non Mutual defensive collateral estoppel occurs when a defendant seeks to prevent a plaintiff from asserting a claim the plaintiff has previously litigated and lost against another defendant. Nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel allows a plaintiff to foreclose a defendant from relitigating an issue the defendant has previously litigated and lost. Courts exercise discretion in applying nonmutual collateral estoppel, particularly offensive, to avoid unfairness or inequity.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A defendant in a current personal injury lawsuit was previously sued by a different plaintiff for negligence in a separate case involving a similar incident at the same location. The first case went to trial, and the jury found the defendant negligent. In the current case, the defendant attempts to use nonmutual defensive collateral estoppel to argue that the current plaintiff, who was not a party to the previous case, should not be allowed to claim negligence since this issue was already litigated and decided. Conversely, the current plaintiff seeks to invoke nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel to prevent the defendant from arguing they were not negligent, given the prior jury&apos;s finding. The court, using its discretion, may apply nonmutual defensive collateral estoppel to protect the defendant from inconsistent judgments and conserve judicial resources. However, it may hesitate to apply nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel if the defendant had limited incentive to defend the previous suit vigorously, the current plaintiff could have joined the first action, or applying it would be unfair to the defendant in the current context.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Exceptions and Limitations</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Both doctrines do not apply to jurisdictional determinations, and collateral estoppel does not apply if there is a significant change in the legal context or factual circumstances.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff wins a negligence lawsuit against a defendant for damages resulting from a car accident. Consequently, the defendant&apos;s driver&rsquo;s license is revoked due to the incident. The defendant seeks to appeal the revocation, but since the revocation is a jurisdictional matter tied to the state&apos;s power to regulate driver&rsquo;s licenses, neither the collateral order doctrine nor collateral estoppel would block the defendant&apos;s appeal of the license revocation. Later, new evidence emerges that there were faulty traffic lights at the accident scene, which the defendant believes contributed to the accident. The defendant cannot use collateral estoppel to prevent the plaintiff from suing again for the same accident, as the new evidence represents a significant change in factual circumstances that could alter the outcome of the case.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>





<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Final Judgment Rule</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The Final Judgment Rule, codified in 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1291, provides that an appeal may be taken to a court of appeals from a final decision of a district court. A final decision is one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff files a lawsuit against a defendant for breach of contract, seeking damages in a federal district court. After the trial concludes, the court rules in favor of the plaintiff, granting a sum of money as compensation. The court&apos;s decision is a final judgment because it resolves the central dispute between the parties on the merits of the case and there are no further issues left to be adjudicated regarding the breach of contract claim. The defendant can now appeal this decision to the court of appeals. Conversely, during the course of the same litigation, the court denies a motion by the defendant to exclude certain testimony. This order is not a final decision, as it does not conclude the litigation; the case proceeds and the denial simply relates to a procedural matter within the larger context of the ongoing lawsuit. Therefore, this order is not immediately appealable under &sect; 1291. The defendant must wait for the final decision of the court to appeal this and any other interlocutory decisions that have been made during the litigation.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Collateral Order Doctrine</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The Collateral Order Doctrine serves as an exception to the Final Judgment Rule, created by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp. This doctrine permits immediate appeals of decisions that do not represent final orders but meet three criteria: (1) the order conclusively resolves an issue distinct from the merits of the case, (2) the order addresses an important legal question separate from the case&rsquo;s substance, and (3) the order would evade effective review if not addressed immediately.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff sues a defendant for damages related to a breach of contract. Before the trial concludes, the plaintiff also files a motion for an injunction to prevent the defendant from continuing the actions that are allegedly in breach of the contract. The court denies the motion for an injunction, stating that the injunction sought would not resolve the underlying breach of contract claim. The plaintiff appeals the denial of the injunction under the collateral order doctrine. The appellate court accepts the appeal because the injunction order is effectively separate from the merits of the breach of contract claim&mdash;it seeks to prevent further harm rather than adjudicate past actions. The order is also effectively unreviewable later, as failing to stop the defendant&apos;s actions immediately could cause irreparable harm that a final judgment on the contract dispute wouldn&apos;t address. Conversely, the defendant files a motion to disqualify the plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyer due to a conflict of interest. The court denies this motion, and the defendant attempts to appeal this order. The appellate court rejects the appeal under the collateral order doctrine because the issue of attorney disqualification is intertwined with the conduct of the trial itself and does not represent a separate issue that would remain unreviewed until after a final judgment.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Interlocutory Appeals Act</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">The Interlocutory Appeals Act, under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1292, allows for appeals in certain circumstances before the case reaches a final decision. Common issues on which an interlocutory appeal can be filed include:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Injunctions</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Temporary restraining orders</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Orders</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Receiverships</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Admiralty cases</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:decimal;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Certain orders in patent infringement cases regarding the transfer of interest.</span></p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Alternatively, Section 1292(b) provides a mechanism for interlocutory appeal of non-final orders if the trial judge certifies that the order involves a controlling question of law over which there is substantial disagreement and that an immediate appeal could substantially expedite resolution of the lawsuit.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Defendant files a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent Plaintiff from using trade secrets allegedly obtained unlawfully. The district court grants the injunction. Plaintiff can immediately appeal this order under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1292(a)(1) because it is an injunction. Meanwhile, in the same case, the district court makes a non-final order deciding that certain complex software code is a protectable trade secret. Recognizing the potential for a substantial difference of opinion on this complex legal question and that resolving it on appeal might eliminate the need for a trial, the district court certifies the order for interlocutory appeal under &sect; 1292(b). Defendant may seek immediate appellate review before trial to determine if the software code is legally considered a trade secret, which could materially advance resolution of the case. If the appellate court agrees with the district court, the case proceeds under the premise that the code is a trade secret; if the appellate court disagrees, the case could be resolved without a trial.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Writs of Mandamus</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Writs of mandamus are issued by appellate courts to direct lower courts or other governmental bodies to perform a specific duty correctly according to the law. It is not a substitute for an appeal but is instead used in exceptional situations where an error by the lower court is clear and there is no other adequate remedy available to correct it.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Plaintiff sues a real estate company in federal district court alleging fraud. During the proceedings, Plaintiff requests the judge to order the disclosure of certain crucial documents. The judge denies this request. Plaintiff believes the documents are essential to prove the claim and that without them, the case cannot proceed fairly. As there are no other means to attain the documents and an appeal at the end of the case would be inadequate because the essential evidence would be lacking at trial, Plaintiff seeks a writ of mandamus from the appellate court to compel the judge to order the disclosure. The appellate court considers the writ because it presents a scenario where the judge has a non-discretionary duty to allow evidence discovery, the usual appeal process cannot correct the error post-trial, and the Plaintiff has no other means to obtain the necessary documents.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Writs of Prohibition</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A writ of prohibition is a legal measure employed by a higher court to prevent a lower court or government official from taking action beyond their jurisdictional power. It essentially commands the recipient to halt a proceeding or action that is outside their lawful authority.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">An appellate court issues a writ of prohibition to a trial court where the trial court has attempted to take on a case involving a matter of federal patent law, which is exclusively within the jurisdiction of federal courts. The writ directs the trial court to cease proceedings in the case, as it is beyond the trial court&apos;s authority to decide on federal patent issues. Conversely, the appellate court denies a writ of prohibition against a trial court proceeding with a criminal case, because the trial court is within its jurisdiction to try criminal matters, and there is no excess of jurisdiction or usurpation of power warranting a writ of prohibition.</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Appeal from Partial Final Judgment Under Rule 54(b)</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">Rule 54(b) of the FRCP allows a district court to issue a final judgment on some aspects of a case while other issues remain pending. To do so, the court must provide a clear statement that there is no cause to delay the appeal of the adjudicated matters. This rule aims to balance the tension between the undesirability of piecemeal appeals and the imperative to provide timely relief when certain issues are conclusively decided.</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">A plaintiff files a lawsuit against a defendant for both breach of contract and defamation. As the case progresses, the court finds in favor of the plaintiff on the breach of contract claim, awarding damages. However, the defamation claim requires additional evidence and remains unresolved. Recognizing the distinct and separable nature of the breach of contract claim, the court invokes FRCP 54(b) to enter a final judgment on this claim alone, stating there is no just reason for delay. This allows the plaintiff to appeal the breach of contract judgment immediately, while litigation continues on the unresolved defamation claim.</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-size:12pt;">Standards of Review</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt;">When an appellate court reviews a case, it uses various standards of review to evaluate the decisions of the lower courts. The standard selected often depends on the nature of the issue being reviewed, whether it&apos;s a question of conclusions of law, discretionary decisions, or factual findings. If a legal error impacted the trial&apos;s outcome, it is reviewed; if not, the error is considered harmless and not reviewed.</span></p>

    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a contract dispute case, the trial court interprets a clause of the contract and rules in favor of the plaintiff, deciding that the clause obligates the defendant to pay a certain sum of money. The defendant appeals, arguing that the trial court misinterpreted the clause. On appeal, the appellate court conducts a de novo review of the trial court&rsquo;s interpretation of the contractual clause. The appellate court does not give any deference to the trial court&apos;s interpretation and re-examines the contract language from scratch to make its own determination on the issue of law, which is the proper interpretation of the clause in question.</span></p>

<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a contract dispute trial, the plaintiff seeks an extension to submit additional evidence, claiming unexpected delays in evidence gathering. The trial court grants a short extension, considering the plaintiff&rsquo;s diligence and unforeseen obstacles. However, the defendant argues that this decision is an abuse of discretion, seeking appellate review. The appellate court upholds the trial court&rsquo;s decision, noting that it falls within the bounds of reasonable choice, governed by the judge&apos;s discretion, and the extension does not prejudicially affect the defendant or the proceeding&rsquo;s integrity. Conversely, in a different scenario, the plaintiff repeatedly fails to produce evidence in a timely manner, showing a pattern of disregard for court deadlines. The trial court grants a lengthy extension despite the plaintiff&apos;s lack of justification and the defendant&apos;s strong objections. The appellate court finds this to be an abuse of discretion, as it oversteps the reasonable bounds by ignoring the plaintiff&apos;s consistent delays and the burden imposed on the defendant, thus requiring a correction of the trial court&rsquo;s decision.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size:12pt;">In a property dispute, the plaintiff asserts that their land survey shows their ownership of a contested piece of land, while the defendant presents a conflicting survey. The trial court rules in favor of the defendant, stating that their survey is more credible. The plaintiff appeals, arguing the ruling was clearly erroneous. The appellate court, upon review, examines the evidence presented and holds a firm belief that a mistake was made; the trial court&apos;s decision improperly assessed the credibility of the surveys. The appellate court concludes that the trial court&apos;s factual finding was clearly erroneous and reverses the decision, ordering a new trial to determine ownership based on the preponderance of evidence.</span></p>
