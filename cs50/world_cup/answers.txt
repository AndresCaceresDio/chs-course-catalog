Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The amount of running time did not increase linearly as I had predicted, but it increased exponentially.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After 10000 simulations because I can get an accurate answer with a running time that is still relatively small.
