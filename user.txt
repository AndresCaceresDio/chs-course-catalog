That company was a reputable supplier of beef products. On Sunday evening, the woman prepared a sandwich for lunch the next day, using the can of corned beef she had bought on Saturday. When the plaintiff bit into her sandwich at lunch time the next day, a large sliver of bone concealed in the corned beef slice pierced between her teeth, broke one off, and came to rest deep in the roof of her mouth.

At the trial, the plaintiff proved all of the above facts leading up to her injury as well as the elements of her damage. The local beef company proved that it had not processed and packed the corned beef, but that such had been done by its regular and independent supplier. The local beef company further proved that it had never obtained from its supplier defective meat products, and that it had no way of knowing that the can contained any dangerous material. The grocery store proved that it had no way of knowing the content of the can was likely to cause harm, and that it had sold the products of the local beef company for a number of years without ever having been told by a customer that the products were defective. Both defendants agreed by stipulation in open court that the supplier had been guilty of negligence in packing the corned beef containing the sliver of bone.

On Thursday, a student attended the professor's four o'clock class. By five minutes past four, the student was sound asleep in his seat. At ten minutes past four, the teaching assistant locked the classroom door as instructed by the professor, unlocking it at ten minutes to five.

The classroom had been painted the previous day with a paint to which the student was allergic, although neither the professor, the teaching assistant, nor the student knew about it. As a result of his exposure to the paint in the room, the student developed allergic symptoms later that day that required hospitalization.\n\nIf the student institutes an action for false imprisonment against the professor, who will win?\n\n(A) The student, because his illness resulted from the professor's intentional confinement of him.\n(B) The student, since a professor owes her students a duty to refrain from exposing them to unreasonable risks of foreseeable harm.\n(C) The professor, since she did not know with substantial certainty that harm would result from locking the door.\n(D) The professor, since she did not confine the student against his will.\nCorrect Answer: D"}]}
